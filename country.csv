An embrace and one kiss on the cheek is common between friends and acquaintances.","Argentines are touchers and stand close to each other when speaking. Do not back away.

The “O.K.” and “thumbs up” gestures are considered vulgar.

The person who makes the invitation generally pays the bill in restaurants. However, it isn't unusual for friends to split the bill.

Australians follow continental-style dining etiquette (fork held in the left hand; knife in right).","Stick with standard English, not Aussie terms.

Aussies dislike class distinctions and have a history of ""cutting down the tall poppy."" This grew out of the Australian prisoners' hatred of their British overseers. Many Australian politicians have declined the designation of knighthood for fear of alienating their constituents.

Australians sit in the front seat of a taxi/limousine. A single passenger sitting in the back seat is viewed as ""putting on airs."""
"Austria","Shake hands with everyone present--men, women and children--at a business or social meeting; shake hands with women before men. Women should offer their hand first. Shake hands again when leaving.

Take the time to get to know your Bolivian customers and colleagues. Personal relationships are vital to corporate success.

Be prepared for lengthy meals (two hours or more for lunch). Do not discuss business during meals unless your host brings it up. Business may occasionally be discussed at dinner in São Paulo or Rio.

Brazilians always wash their hands before eating and rarely touch food with their hands. Use a knife and fork for everything, even fruit. Always use a napkin while eating or drinking.","Don’t assume that the ""self-made"" businessperson is admired in Brazil. Inherited wealth and a good family background are much more desirable.

Brazilians are extremely casual about time. Being ten to fifteen minutes late in business is normal, and twenty to thirty minutes late is not unusual. Be on time for a formal meeting, but prepare to wait for your Brazilian colleagues.

Soccer (football), family, Brazil’s beautiful beaches and the country’s rapid growth are all appropriate conversation topics. Politics, poverty, religion, Argentina (considered a rival) and the deforestation of Brazil are not. Personal topics such as age, salary and marital or job status are also unacceptable."
"Canada","In general, Canadians are more reserved and polite than Americans, and take matters of etiquette a little more seriously.

A premium is placed on time.","To beckon a waiter in Quebec, quietly to say ""Monsieur"" or ""S'il vous plait. Say ""Mademoiselle"" to beckon a waitress. Never beckon a waiter or waitress by snapping your fingers or shouting.

The host normally offers first toast. Wait until everyone is served wine and a toast is proposed before drinking. It is acceptable for women to propose a toast.

Wine is normally served with meals in Quebec.","Do your homework about Canada. Most Americans are appallingly ignorant of Canadian history, culture and geography.

Chileans don’t like to feel pressured or rushed. Business may be conducted more slowly than in Europe and North America.

Red tape can be minimized considerably if you have the right connections.","Business lunches are usually long and are held in restaurants, hotels or residences.

Be prepared for long meetings and lengthy negotiations (often ten days straight) with many delays.","Dining is used to probe positions without any formal commitment. Business is generally not discussed during meals. Meals are a vehicle for indirect business references.

The Chinese are superb hosts. Twelve-course banquets with frequent toasts are a Chinese trademark.

The Chinese sponsoring organization generally hosts a welcoming banquet. Foreign guests should reciprocate toward the end of their visits. Invite everyone with whom you have dealt.

Always arrive exactly on time for a banquet. Never arrive early for dinner. This implies that you are hungry and might cause you to lose face.","Chinese find ""no"" difficult to say. They may say ""maybe"" or ""we'll see"" in order to save face.

Follow up a meeting by sending a letter summarizing the main points and what was agreed upon.

It may take several trips to complete a business transaction. Colombians prefer to do business in person -- one can only get “so far” by phone and fax.","Time and punctuality are not stressed. Colombians will typically arrive up to thirty minutes late for social engagements. A 10:00 p.m. party will often begin a half-hour to one hour late.

Working breakfasts are common, and business lunches and dinners are popular. Plan on spending at least two or three hours at either.","Don't offer your opinions about local politics or religion.

Be prudent when you talk about drugs. Colombia is working with the United States' government in the war against drugs, but U.S. foreign policy is not viewed positively by many Colombians.

If you are invited to a bullfight, do not decline. Tickets for good seats are very expensive.

Do not be offended if you are called a “gringo.” Colombians use this term to refer to people from the United States, and it is not meant to be insulting."

"United States","American greetings are generally quite informal. This is not intended to show lack of respect, but rather a manifestation of the American belief that everyone is equal.

Although it is expected in business situations, some Americans do not shake hands at social events. Instead, they may greet you with a casual ""Hello"" or ""How are you?"" or even just ""Hi."" In larger groups, many may not greet you at all. In social situations, Americans rarely shake hands upon leaving.

The only proper answers to the greetings ""How do you do?"" ""How are you?"" or ""How are you doing?"" are ""Fine,"" ""Great,"" or ""Very well, thank you."" This is not a request for information about your well-being; it is simply a pleasantry.","Keep your distance when conversing. If an American feels you are standing too close, he or she may step back without even thinking about it.

People who like to touch really like touching, and people who do not like to touch really dislike being touched. You will need to watch your colleagues for clues on what they are comfortable with.

Holding the middle finger up by itself is considered insulting and vulgar.","Men: socks should match your suit. No leg should show between pant hem and shoe. Remove your hat when indoors.

There is no set ritual for exchanging business cards.

Americans prefer directness in communication. When Americans say ""yes"" or ""no,"" they mean precisely that. ""Maybe"" really does mean ""it might happen""; it does not mean ""no.""

The guest of honor is often toasted and should reciprocate by giving a toast of thanks.","It is considered rude to stare, ask questions or otherwise bring attention to someone's disability.

Smoking is very unpopular in the United States. Restaurants have separate smoking and nonsmoking sections. Public and private buildings may ban smoking except in designated areas. Some people do not allow smoking in their homes and will ask you to go outside if you want to have a cigarette. Never smoke anywhere without asking permission from everyone present.

Names are not held as sacred in the United States. Someone may mispronounce your name and laugh a bit as they do it. Or someone may just call you by your given name if your family name is too difficult to pronounce.

There are several common names and nicknames that are used by both men and women. Call the person's assistant to ask if you are unsure of his or her gender."
