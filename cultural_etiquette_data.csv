Argentina,The People,"Argentines are very proud of their country and culture. They are 
            well-educated and sophisticated and like to be viewed as 
            cosmopolitan and progressive. Because 85% of Argentina’s population 
            hails from Italy, Spain, Austria, France, Germany, Great Britain, 
            Portugal, Russia, Switzerland, Poland and the Middle East, 
            Argentines tend to identify with Europeans. It has been said that 
            Argentines are a nation of Italians who speak Spanish and think 
            they’re British living in Paris. Predominantly Catholic (93%), 
            families are highly valued and hold conservative values."

            a great love for the outdoors (i.e., walking, skiing, climbing, 
            etc.). Although predominantly Catholic (89%), traditional family 
            values have been weakened by modern life and government legislation.

Belgium,The People,"Belgium is comprised of two primary cultural groups. The 
            Dutch-speaking Flemings live in Flanders, in the north, and make up 
            55% of the population. The French-speaking Walloons live in 
            Wallonia, in the south, and make up 33% of the population. Hard work 
            and an appreciation for culture are important values to Belgians, 
            who think of themselves as Europeans first, Walloons or Flemings 
            second, and Belgians third. Strong family systems are vital to

            in the social system. Education is valued, but still not achievable 
            for all people. Although it is legally compulsory for ages six to 
            14, fewer than half of all children finish primary education."

Brazil,The People,"Brazilians are friendly and free-spirited, with an incredible 
            zest for life. They are very risk-oriented and very creative. 
            Predominantly Roman Catholic (73%), families are large and often

              Brazil. Inherited wealth and a good family background are much 
              more desirable."
Brazil,The People,"Brazilians are extremely casual about time. Being ten to 
              fifteen minutes late in business is normal, and twenty to thirty

Brazil,The People,"Soccer (football), family, Brazil’s beautiful beaches and the 
              country’s rapid growth are all appropriate conversation topics. 
              Politics, poverty, religion, Argentina (considered a rival) and

Brazil,The People,"As women increasingly join the workforce, machismo has become 
            less common. Younger, better-educated women have values that 
            correspond closely to those of North American women. Women are

Brazil,The People,Especially for Men
Brazil,The People,"Brazilian women can be very aggressive romantically and forward 
            to the point of harassment. Don’t be surprised if you are in a 
            restaurant or nightclub and a woman sends you a note asking for your 
            phone number — even if you are with your wife or girlfriend. Foreign 
            men traveling to Brazil should be very cautious when dealing with 
            Brazilian women. If you don’t want the attention, be cordial but 
            keep your distance. Don’t be overly friendly."

Brazil,Body Language,Dress
Brazil,Body Language,"Appearance counts. Your clothing will reflect upon you and

Brazil,Body Language,"Brazilian women dress ""sexy"" in all situations, whether

Brazil,Body Language,"Shoes should be stylish, polished and well-kept. Nails should 
              be manicured."
Brazil,Body Language,"In business situations, men should wear conservative dark 
              suits, shirts and ties. Three piece suits indicate executives; two

              dresses, suits and pantsuits and avoid ""dressing like a man."""
Brazil,Body Language,Gifts
Brazil,Body Language,"Gifts are not important in establishing a business 
              relationship, and people won’t expect gifts in the first few 
              contacts. A very expensive gift may be viewed as a bribe."
Brazil,Body Language,"Present a gift at a social meeting, not during a formal

Brazil,Body Language,Helpful Hints
Brazil,Body Language,"Don’t assume that the ""self-made"" businessperson is admired in 
              Brazil. Inherited wealth and a good family background are much 
              more desirable."
Brazil,Body Language,"Brazilians are extremely casual about time. Being ten to 
              fifteen minutes late in business is normal, and twenty to thirty 
              minutes late is not unusual. Be on time for a formal meeting, but 
              prepare to wait for your Brazilian colleagues."
Brazil,Body Language,"Soccer (football), family, Brazil’s beautiful beaches and the 
              country’s rapid growth are all appropriate conversation topics. 
              Politics, poverty, religion, Argentina (considered a rival) and 
              the deforestation of Brazil are not. Personal topics such as age, 
              salary and marital or job status are also unacceptable."
Brazil,Body Language,"Brazilians are expressive and passionate conversationalists. 
              Be prepared to be interrupted."

              places."
Brazil,Body Language,Don’t refer to Brazilians as Latins.
Brazil,Body Language,Especially for Women
Brazil,Body Language,"As women increasingly join the workforce, machismo has become 
            less common. Younger, better-educated women have values that 
            correspond closely to those of North American women. Women are 
            well-accepted and are prominent in education, medicine and 
            journalism and as small business owners."

              and personal lives."

              too professional."
Brazil,Body Language,"It is traditional to invite someone for a drink after work. 
              This is not a come-on."
Brazil,Body Language,Especially for Men
Brazil,Body Language,"Brazilian women can be very aggressive romantically and forward 
            to the point of harassment. Don’t be surprised if you are in a 
            restaurant or nightclub and a woman sends you a note asking for your 
            phone number — even if you are with your wife or girlfriend. Foreign 
            men traveling to Brazil should be very cautious when dealing with 
            Brazilian women. If you don’t want the attention, be cordial but 
            keep your distance. Don’t be overly friendly."

              right down to business. Engage in conversation first."

              communication. You will be able to do only limited business by 
              phone, fax or e-mail."
Brazil,Corporate Culture,"Some facts may not be completely accurate during the early 
              stages of business negotiations. Brazilians expect some initial 
              hype and will passionately argue their points, slowly and 
              grudgingly making concessions. Try to maintain consistency in your 
              negotiating team."

Brazil,Corporate Culture,"Brazilians always wash their hands before eating and rarely

            men traveling to Brazil should be very cautious when dealing with 
            Brazilian women. If you don’t want the attention, be cordial but 
            keep your distance. Don’t be overly friendly."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,"Don’t assume that the ""self-made"" businessperson is admired in 
              Brazil. Inherited wealth and a good family background are much 
              more desirable."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,"Brazilians are extremely casual about time. Being ten to 
              fifteen minutes late in business is normal, and twenty to thirty 
              minutes late is not unusual. Be on time for a formal meeting, but 
              prepare to wait for your Brazilian colleagues."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,"Soccer (football), family, Brazil’s beautiful beaches and the 
              country’s rapid growth are all appropriate conversation topics. 
              Politics, poverty, religion, Argentina (considered a rival) and 
              the deforestation of Brazil are not. Personal topics such as age, 
              salary and marital or job status are also unacceptable."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,"Brazilians are expressive and passionate conversationalists. 
              Be prepared to be interrupted."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,"Don’t smoke in public. Federal law bans smoking in public 
              places."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,Don’t refer to Brazilians as Latins.
Brazil,Helpful Hints,Especially for Women
Brazil,Helpful Hints,"As women increasingly join the workforce, machismo has become 
            less common. Younger, better-educated women have values that 
            correspond closely to those of North American women. Women are 
            well-accepted and are prominent in education, medicine and 
            journalism and as small business owners."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,"Brazilian women are very aggressive, in both their business 
              and personal lives."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,"Foreign women will usually have no problem doing business in 
              Brazil. However, some people are still conservative in this 
              regard."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,"Be very careful not to ruin a business deal by being cool and 
              too professional."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,"It is traditional to invite someone for a drink after work. 
              This is not a come-on."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,Especially for Men
Brazil,Helpful Hints,"Brazilian women can be very aggressive romantically and forward 
            to the point of harassment. Don’t be surprised if you are in a 
            restaurant or nightclub and a woman sends you a note asking for your 
            phone number — even if you are with your wife or girlfriend. Foreign

Canada,The People,"The vast majority of Canadians claim European ancestry. Four in 
            nine Canadians claim some British ancestry and a little less than 
            one in three have some French ancestry. Eighty percent of the 
            residents in Quebec have French ancestry. Eighty percent of native 
            French speakers live in Quebec (the others are mostly in New 
            Brunswick, and parts of Ontario and Manitoba). Other European groups 
            include Italians, Germans and Ukrainians (especially in the prairie 
            states)."
Canada,The People,"Broadly speaking, Canada has been divided into two distinct 
            societies, one French-speaking (see ""Quebec"" below) and one 
            English-speaking. Because they don't form as cohesive a group as 
            French-speaking Canadians, only very general observations can be 
            made about English-speaking Canadians; they are generally thought of 
            (and consider themselves) more reserved, less aggressive and less 
            excitable than their neighbors to the south."
Canada,The People,"Most Canadians identify themselves very strongly with their 
            province. Canadians continue to wrestle with the question, ""What 
            does it mean to be Canadian?"" and take pains to differentiate 
            themselves from citizens of the United States."
Canada,The People,Regional Differences
Canada,The People,"Atlantic Canada (includes the Maritimes -- Nova Scotia, New 
            Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island -- and Newfoundland): Primarily 
            of British descent, the residents of the less prosperous Atlantic 
            provinces of eastern Canada are generally more reserved, stolid, 
            provincial and old-fashioned. Newfoundland is unique, with a dialect 
            and culture that draws comparisons with the Irish and the people of 
            western England."
Canada,The People,"Ontario: Residents of Canada's most populous province -- the 
            country's economic, political and cultural colossus -- are generally 
            thought of as more business-like and conservative than other 
            Canadians."
Canada,The People,"Western Canada (includes Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba): 
            Residents of Canada's western provinces are generally more open, 
            relaxed, friendly and direct than other Canadians (comparisons are 
            often made with inhabitants of the western United States)."
Canada,The People,"British Columbia: Canada's unconventional westernmost province is 
            seen by Canadians as the land of the future, and has more in common 
            with Seattle than Toronto. Like many other western Canadians, many 
            residents of British Columbia feel somewhat estranged from 
            ""easterners"" (a general code word for those from Ontario and 
            Quebec)."
Canada,The People,"Quebec (and other areas of Francophone Canada): French Canadians, 
            and especially the Québécois (or citizens of Quebec, pronounced 
            ""keh-beck-wah"") have a very strong sense of cultural identity and 
            are very nationalistic. The European influence is strongly felt in 
            Quebec, whose people consider themselves the ""defenders of French 
            civilization in North America."" Because of their animated good 
            nature, Québécois are sometimes called the ""Latins of the North."""
Canada,The People,"The North: Residents of the sparsely populated north are seen as 
            rugged embodiments of the Canadian pioneer spirit."
Canada,The People,Meeting and Greeting
Canada,The People,"In general, Canadians are more reserved and polite than 
              Americans, and take matters of etiquette a little more seriously."
Canada,The People,"Shake hands and introduce yourself when meeting Canadians for 
              the first time. Always shake hands firmly when meeting or 
              departing. Eye contact is important."
Canada,The People,"When a woman enters or leaves a room, it is polite for men to 
              rise. Men normally offer their hands to women."
Canada,The People,"In Quebec, kissing on the cheeks in the French manner is quite 
              common. When close friends and family meet in Quebec, they use 
              first names and kiss both cheeks."
Canada,The People,"An older French Canadian man may kiss the hand of a woman. 
              Accept this gesture graciously. A foreign man shouldn't kiss the 
              hand of a French Canadian woman, who would be quite shocked."
Canada,The People,"Canadians are somewhat more formal than Americans with regard 
              to names and titles. Use last names and appropriate titles until 
              invited by your Canadian hosts or colleagues to use their first 
              names. First names are normally used only by close friends and 
              family. Western Canadians may use first names more frequently than 
              other Canadians."
Canada,The People,"In Quebec, coworkers of similiar status generally use first 
              names in private, but always last names in public. The formal 
              ""you"" is almost always used in a business setting, even after 20 
              years."
Canada,The People,"Academic titles and degrees are important to French Canadians. 
              You should know and use them properly."
Canada,The People,Language
Canada,The People,"English and French are both official languages of business in 
              Canada. However, virtually all international business is conducted 
              in English."
Canada,The People,"Most French Canadians speak and understand English, but prefer 
              to use French. Check ahead of time to find out if an interpreter 
              will be necessary."
Canada,The People,Body Language
Canada,The People,"Generally speaking, Canadians are more reserved than 
              Americans. Canadians generally don't touch very much when 
              conversing. Maintaining a certain amount of personal space is 
              important."
Canada,The People,"French Canadians are generally more animated and expressive 
              than other Canadians."
Canada,The People,Take off your hat or sunglasses when speaking with someone.
Canada,The People,"Some gestures have different meanings in Quebec. For example, 
              ""thumbs down"" is considered offensive in Quebec, as is slapping an 
              open palm over a closed fist. Like the rest of their countrymen 
              and women, French-Canadians use the ""thumbs up"" sign to mean 
              ""okay. ""The ""okay"" sign made with the index finger and thumb means 
              ""zero"" in Quebec."
Canada,The People,"In Quebec, sit straight with your legs crossed at the knee, or 
              with your knees together. Don't sit with your legs apart, or with 
              your feet propped up on tables or chairs."
Canada,The People,"It's considered bad form by many in Quebec to talk with your 
              hands in your pockets."
Canada,The People,"Sneeze or blow your nose as quietly as possible using a 
              handkerchief or tissue. If possible, leave the room. Do not yawn 
              or scratch in public. Toothpicks, nail clippers, and combs are 
              never used in public."
Canada,The People,Corporate Culture
Canada,The People,"Punctuality is demanded for business meetings and social 
              occasions. If a conflict arises, you are expected to let your 
              Canadian counterpart know immediately. That said, Canadians are 
              not as obsessed with time as Americans."
Canada,The People,Business cards are commonly exchanged in Canada.
Canada,The People,"For Quebec, print your business cards in English or French, 
              including your academic degree(s) and/or title. A double-sided 
              business card (one side in English, one side in French) is best."
Canada,The People,"Canadians get down to business quickly. Meetings are 
              well-organized, and extraneous discussion is kept to a minimum. A 
              premium is placed on time."
Canada,The People,"Business communication is quite direct in Canada, but more 
              reserved than in the United States. Letters and telephone calls 
              should be direct and succinct. Pleasantries are dispensed with 
              very quickly."
Canada,The People,"Business culture varies somewhat throughout Canada, depending 
              on the region."
Canada,The People,"Although the relationship between Canada and the United States 
              is generally quite good, some Canadians may be wary about the 
              intentions of American businesses and put off by what they 
              perceive as American arrogance. Some Canadians may dislike the 
              American ""hard sell"" approach."
Canada,The People,Dining and Entertainment
Canada,The People,"To beckon a waiter in Quebec, quietly to say ""Monsieur"" or 
              ""S'il vous plait. Say ""Mademoiselle"" to beckon a waitress. Never 
              beckon a waiter or waitress by snapping your fingers or shouting."
Canada,The People,"The host normally offers first toast. Wait until everyone is 
              served wine and a toast is proposed before drinking. It is 
              acceptable for women to propose a toast."
Canada,The People,Wine is normally served with meals in Quebec.
Canada,The People,"In Quebec, it's considered bad form to ask for a martini or 
              scotch before dinner — French Canadians consider them ""palate 
              numbing."" Typical before-dinner drinks include Pernod, kir, 
              champagne, and vermouth. Cognac, Grand Marnier and/or other 
              liqueurs are served after dinner."
Canada,The People,"Business entertainment is common, but the focus usually 
              remains on business. The person who invites is normally expected 
              to pay."
Canada,The People,"Etiquette and formalities are more important in Canada than in 
              the United States."
Canada,The People,"While continental-style table manners are employed in Quebec, 
              American style table manners are seen in other parts of the 
              country."
Canada,The People,"Eating while walking or standing on the street in Quebec is 
              considered bad form."
Canada,The People,"Never arrive early for a social occasion. Opt, instead, for 
              being ""fashionably late."" Showing up early at a bar or disco in 
              Quebec (at, say, 10 o'clock) immediately marks you as an ""Anglo."""
Canada,The People,Dress
Canada,The People,"Generally speaking, Canadians dress more conservatively (and 
              more formally when going out) than their American neighbors, 
              although practices vary by region. Dress in Vancouver, for 
              example, is somewhat more casual; in Toronto more British. French 
              Canadians dress in a more relaxed European style than their fellow 
              Canadians."
Canada,The People,"For business meetings, men should wear suits and ties; women 
              should wear conservative suits or dresses."
Canada,The People,Gifts
Canada,The People,"Bring flowers, fine wine or chocolates for the hostess when 
              invited to a Canadian home. Avoid red roses (associated with 
              romantic love) and white lilies (associated with funerals)."
Canada,The People,Helpful Hints
Canada,The People,"Do your homework about Canada. Most Americans are appallingly 
              ignorant of Canadian history, culture and geography."
Canada,The People,"Recognize that important regional differences exist in Canada 
              and prepare to adapt."
Canada,The People,"When in Quebec, learn a little French; Québécois greatly 
              appreciate it when you take the effort to talk to them in their 
              native language."
Canada,The People,Do not compare Canada with the United States.
Canada,The People,"Do not use the term ""Native Americans"" to refer to indigenous 
              peoples. Many Canadians find the term offensive. Canadians refer 
              to members of these groups as ""people of the First Nations."""
Canada,The People,"Do not take sides in debates about contentious national issues 
              (especially when they concern such issues the status of Quebec, 
              the place of the French and English languages in Canadian society, 
              etc.)."

              example, is somewhat more casual; in Toronto more British. French

Canada,Body Language,"When in Quebec, learn a little French; Québécois greatly

              native language."
Canada,Body Language,Do not compare Canada with the United States.
Canada,Body Language,"Do not use the term ""Native Americans"" to refer to indigenous

Canada,Body Language,"Do not take sides in debates about contentious national issues 
              (especially when they concern such issues the status of Quebec,

Canada,Corporate Culture,"Punctuality is demanded for business meetings and social 
              occasions. If a conflict arises, you are expected to let your

              not as obsessed with time as Americans."
Canada,Corporate Culture,Business cards are commonly exchanged in Canada.
Canada,Corporate Culture,"For Quebec, print your business cards in English or French,

Canada,Corporate Culture,"Canadians get down to business quickly. Meetings are 
              well-organized, and extraneous discussion is kept to a minimum. A 
              premium is placed on time."
Canada,Corporate Culture,"Business communication is quite direct in Canada, but more 
              reserved than in the United States. Letters and telephone calls 
              should be direct and succinct. Pleasantries are dispensed with 
              very quickly."

              on the region."
Canada,Corporate Culture,"Although the relationship between Canada and the United States 
              is generally quite good, some Canadians may be wary about the 
              intentions of American businesses and put off by what they 
              perceive as American arrogance. Some Canadians may dislike the

Chile,The People,"Chileans are very nationalistic and are proud of their country, 
            as well as of their literacy -- the 95% rate puts them among the 
            best educated in the world. Predominantly Roman Catholic (89%), 
            family is the primary structure of society. The father is still 
            considered the head of the family, but the mother is an important 
            decision-maker. People are judged by their educational and family 
            backgrounds, not by race."
Chile,The People,Meeting and Greeting
Chile,The People,"Chileans are very warm and expect visitors to reciprocate. 
              They may be formal at first, but move to friendship very quickly."
Chile,The People,"A handshake, a warm hug and one kiss on the right cheek are 
              common greetings among friends."

              considered a vulgar gesture."

Chile,The People,"The business atmosphere in Chile is more formal than in the 
              rest of South America."
Chile,The People,"Punctuality is generally respected and expected in business. 
              However, be prepared for Chileans to be thirty minutes late."
Chile,The People,"Chileans don’t like to feel pressured or rushed. Business may 
              be conducted more slowly than in Europe and North America."
Chile,The People,"Expertise is less important than your personal, family and 
              company background. Family and friendship play a big role in 
              business, and whom one knows is important. Red tape can be 
              minimized considerably if you have the right connections."
Chile,The People,"Establish rapport first. Personal relationships are vital to 
              doing business in Chile. Some light conversation is customary 
              before getting down to business."
Chile,The People,"Decision-making is centralized and decisions are made at the 
              top level, although all levels have input. Visit top-level 
              executives first. Mid-level executives can follow up on subsequent 
              visits."
Chile,The People,"Be prepared to always go through a secretary. Secretaries are 
              screeners for their bosses."

              finish a business transaction."
Chile,The People,"It is acceptable, but not yet common, to communicate via 
              e-mail; don’t expect a quick response."
Chile,The People,"Businesslike behavior with a bit of humor is appreciated. Do 
              not attempt a hard sell approach, and avoid aggressive behavior."
Chile,The People,"Expect to be interrupted. This is not considered rude, but

              financial obligations and options clearly stated."

Chile,The People,"Conversation is free, friendly and open at the table, but be 
              careful not to speak with food in your mouth."
Chile,The People,"Never leave immediately after dinner. Stay for conversation 
              after the meal."
Chile,The People,"An invitation for drinks at a private home generally includes 
              dinner. Guests should reciprocate with comparable hospitality at a 
              later time."
Chile,The People,"There are no separate checks. The person who invites pays. 
              Arrange in advance to pay the bill in a restaurant if you are the 
              host. You will not be presented with a bill in a restaurant until 
              you ask for it."

              thirty minutes late for dinner and thirty minutes late for a party 
              is customary."

Chile,The People,Gifts
Chile,The People,"Business gifts are not expected until a relationship is

              lighters, office accessories, a clock or liquor."
Chile,The People,Open gifts immediately in front of the giver.
Chile,The People,"Bring a bouquet of flowers to the hostess, or send flowers in 
              advance of a party. Give wine, chocolates, local crafts from your 
              home, small porcelain pieces or an art object to hang on a wall. 
              Gifts for children are appreciated."

Chile,The People,"Do not talk about politics or human rights, especially as a 
              foreigner, unless your host initiates the discussion."
Chile,The People,"When smoking, offer a cigarette to everyone. Chileans have a 
              saying for those who neglect to share: ""Did you learn to smoke in 
              jail?"""
Chile,The People,Especially for Women
Chile,The People,"Traditionally, men have dominated private and public life in 
            Chile. However, attitudes are changing at home and in the workplace. 
            Women now make up 30% of the labor. In addition, many women hold 
            important political and business positions as ministers and top 
            executives."
Chile,The People,"Chile is an easier place for women to conduct business than 
              other parts of South America. However, businesswomen may still 
              encounter a machismo ethic."
Chile,The People,"Typical North American businesswomen are often viewed as cold, 
              pushy and non-feminine."
Chile,The People,"Men almost always pay the bill in a restaurant and may be 
              embarrassed if a woman attempts to pay. This shouldn’t be pressed. 
              Don’t argue. If it is important for you to pay, make arrangements 
              in advance."
Chile,The People,"It is common for men to stare at women. It is harmless and 
              meant to flatter."
Chile,Meeting and Greeting,"Chileans are very warm and expect visitors to reciprocate.

China,The People,"Deeply rooted in Chinese society is the need to belong and 
            conform to a unit, whether the family, a political party or an 
            organization. The family is the focus of life for most Chinese. Age 
            and rank are highly respected. However, to the dismay of older 
            people, today's young people are rapidly modernizing, wearing blue 
            jeans and sunglasses, drinking Coke and driving motorbikes."
China,The People,Meeting and Greeting
China,The People,"Shake hands upon meeting. Chinese may nod or bow instead of 
              shaking hands, although shaking hands has become increasingly 
              common."
China,The People,"When introduced to a Chinese group, they may greet you with 
              applause. Applaud back."
China,The People,"Senior persons begin greetings. Greet the oldest, most senior 
              person before others. During group introductions, line up 
              according to seniority with the senior person at the head of the 
              line."
China,The People,Names and Titles
China,The People,"Use family names and appropriate titles until specifically 
              invited by your Chinese host or colleagues to use their given 
              names."
China,The People,"Address the Chinese by Mr., Mrs., Miss plus family name. Note: 
              married women always retain their maiden name."
China,The People,"Chinese are often addressed by their government or 
              professional titles. For example, address Li Pang using his title: 
              Mayor Li or Director Li."
China,The People,"Names may have two parts; for example: Wang Chien. Traditional 
              Chinese family names are placed first with the given name (which 
              has one or two syllables) coming last (family name: Wang; given: 
              Chien)."
China,The People,"Chinese generally introduce their guests using their full 
              titles and company names. You should do the same. Example: Doctor 
              John Smith, CEO of American Data Corporation."
China,The People,Body Language
China,The People,"The Chinese dislike being touched by strangers. Do not touch, 
              hug, lock arms, back slap or make any body contact."
China,The People,Clicking fingers or whistling is considered very rude.
China,The People,"Never put your feet on a desk or a chair. Never gesture or 
              pass an object with your feet."
China,The People,"Blowing one's nose in a handkerchief and returning it to one's 
              pocket is considered vulgar by the Chinese."
China,The People,"To beckon a Chinese person, face the palm of your hand 
              downward and move your fingers in a scratching motion. Never use 
              your index finger to beckon anyone."
China,The People,"Sucking air in quickly and loudly through lips and teeth 
              expresses distress or surprise at a proposed request. Attempt to 
              change your request, allowing the Chinese to save face."
China,The People,"Chinese point with an open hand. Never point with your index 
              finger."
China,The People,Corporate Culture
China,The People,"The Chinese are practical in business and realize they need 
            Western investment, but dislike dependency on foreigners. They are 
            suspicious and fearful of being cheated or pushed around by 
            foreigners, who are perceived as culturally and economically 
            corrupt. It is very difficult to break through the ""them vs. us"" 
            philosophy (foreign partner vs. Chinese). In personal relationships, 
            the Chinese will offer friendship and warm hospitality without 
            conflict, but in business they are astute negotiators."
China,The People,"Punctuality is important for foreign businesspeople. Being 
              late is rude. Meetings always begin on time."
China,The People,"Business cards are exchanged upon meeting. Business cards 
              should be printed in English on one side and Chinese on the other. 
              Make sure the Chinese side uses ""simplified"" characters and not 
              ""classical"" characters, which are used in Taiwan and Hong Kong."
China,The People,"English is not spoken in business meetings, although some 
              Chinese may understand English without making it known. Hire an 
              interpreter or ask for one to be provided."
China,The People,"Be prepared for long meetings and lengthy negotiations (often 
              ten days straight) with many delays."
China,The People,"The Chinese will enter a meeting with the highest-ranking 
              person entering first. They will assume the first member of your 
              group to enter the room is the leader of your delegation. The 
              senior Chinese person welcomes everyone. The foreign leader 
              introduces his/her team, and each member distributes his/her card. 
              The leader invites the Chinese to do the same."
China,The People,"Seating is very important at a meeting. The host sits to the 
              left of the most important guest."
China,The People,"There may be periods of silence at a business meeting; do not 
              interrupt these."
China,The People,"A contract is considered a draft subject to change. Chinese 
              may agree on a deal and then change their minds. A signed contract 
              is not binding and does not mean negotiations will end."
China,The People,"Observing seniority and rank are extremely important in 
              business."
China,The People,"The status of the people who make the initial contact with the 
              Chinese is very important. Don't insult the Chinese by sending 
              someone with a low rank."
China,The People,"Chinese negotiators may try to make foreign negotiators feel 
              guilty about setbacks; they may then manipulate this sense of 
              guilt to achieve certain concessions."
China,The People,"Two Chinese negotiating tricks designed to make you agree to 
              concessions are staged temper tantrums and a feigned sense of 
              urgency."
China,The People,"If the Chinese side no longer wishes to pursue the deal, they 
              may not tell you. To save their own face, they may become 
              increasingly inflexible and hard-nosed, forcing you to break off 
              negotiations. In this way, they may avoid blame for the failure."
China,The People,Dining and Entertainment
China,The People,"Dining is used to probe positions without any formal 
              commitment. Business is generally not discussed during meals. 
              Meals are a vehicle for indirect business references."
China,The People,"The Chinese are superb hosts. Twelve-course banquets with 
              frequent toasts are a Chinese trademark."
China,The People,"The Chinese sponsoring organization generally hosts a 
              welcoming banquet. Foreign guests should reciprocate toward the 
              end of their visits. Invite everyone with whom you have dealt."
China,The People,"Always arrive exactly on time for a banquet. Never arrive 
              early for dinner. This implies that you are hungry and might cause 
              you to lose face."
China,The People,"Spouses are not usually included in business entertaining, 
              however, businesspeople may bring their secretaries."
China,The People,Be prepared to make a small toast for all occasions.
China,The People,"The first toast normally occurs during or after the first 
              course, not before. After the next course, the guest should 
              reciprocate."
China,The People,"Three glasses -- a large one for beer, soda or mineral water, 
              a small wine glass and a stemmed shot glass -- are at each place 
              setting. The shot glass is the one used for toasting."
China,The People,"It is not necessary to always drain your glass after a ganbei 
              (bottoms up), although a host should encourage it."
China,The People,"Do not drink until you toast others at the table. Chinese 
              consider drinking alone to be rude. Simply raising your glass and 
              making eye contact is sufficient. If you are toasted, sip your 
              drink in reply."
China,The People,"A toast to friendship among companies will help cement a 
              business relationship."
China,The People,"Unless you are totally drunk, it is not advised to refuse a 
              drink. Sipping your drink is perfectly acceptable."
China,The People,"Leave some food on your plate during each course of a meal to 
              honor the generosity of your host. It is bad manners for a Chinese 
              host not to keep refilling guests' plates or teacups."
China,The People,"Seating is very important. The guest of honor is always placed 
              at the head of the room, facing the door. Allow the host to begin 
              eating before joining in."
China,The People,"Do not discuss business at dinner unless your Chinese 
              counterpart initiates it."
China,The People,"Slurping soup and belching are acceptable. Cover your mouth 
              with your hand when using a toothpick. Put bones, seeds, etc. on 
              the table, never in your rice bowl."
China,The People,"Chopsticks are used for all meals. Tapping your chopsticks on 
              the table is considered very rude."
China,The People,"When finished eating, place your chopsticks neatly on the 
              table or on the chopstick rest."
China,The People,"When hosting, order one dish for every person present and one 
              extra. In addition, order rice, noodles and buns. Soup usually 
              comes at some point during the meal. The host should tell his/her 
              guests to begin eating a new dish before he digs in himself."
China,The People,The host (the one who invites) pays the bill for everyone.
China,The People,"If you are the guest of honor at a dinner, leave shortly after 
              the meal is finished, as no one will leave before the guest of 
              honor."
China,The People,"Breakfast meetings are rare, but you may request one."
China,The People,"Guests are rarely invited to a Chinese home. It is an honor to 
              be a guest. Be on time or a little early for an invitation, and 
              take a small gift."
China,The People,"Bedrooms and kitchens are private. Don't enter these rooms 
              unless you are invited to do so."
China,The People,"All dishes are served at once in a home. The host will place 
              portions of each dish on guests' plates. Sample each dish."
China,The People,Rare beef is considered barbaric by the Chinese.
China,The People,Dress
China,The People,"Conservative, simple, unpretentious, modest clothing should be 
              worn -- nothing flashy or overly fashionable."
China,The People,"Women should avoid bare backs, shorts, low-cut tops and 
              excessive jewelry."
China,The People,"For business, men should wear sport coats and ties. Slacks and 
              open-necked shirts are generally suitable in the summer for 
              business meetings; jackets and ties are not necessary."
China,The People,"Women should wear dresses or pantsuits for business and should 
              avoid heavy make-up and dangling, gaudy jewelry."
China,The People,Gifts
China,The People,"Present a gift with both hands. Gifts are generally not opened 
              upon receiving. Always give a gift to everyone present or don't 
              give gifts at all."
China,The People,"Older Chinese usually refuse a gift at first to be polite. 
              Offer a second time."
China,The People,"Never give a gift of great value until a clear relationship is 
              established. This would cause embarrassment and may not be 
              accepted. Never give gifts in sets (i.e., dishes), but never in 
              sets of four (a number associated with death)."
China,The People,"Avoid white, which is symbolic of death, especially of 
              parents, and black, which symbolizes tragedy or death."
China,The People,"When invited to someone's home, always bring a small gift for 
              the hostess, such as brandy, chocolates or cakes."
China,The People,"Be prepared to exchange a modest gift with your business 
              colleagues at the first meeting. Not giving a gift could start a 
              business meeting off on the wrong foot."
China,The People,"Always give gifts to each member of the Chinese delegation 
              that meets you in the order in which they were introduced. 
              Suggested gifts: cigarettes (especially Marlboro and Kent), French 
              brandy, whiskey, pens, lighters, desk attire, cognac, books, 
              framed paintings. Give more valuable gifts — like cellular phones 
              or small CD players — to senior level people."
China,The People,"Give a group gift from your company to the host company. 
              Present this gift to the leader of the delegation."
China,The People,Helpful Hints
China,The People,"Chinese find ""no"" difficult to say. They may say ""maybe"" or 
              ""we'll see"" in order to save face."
China,The People,"Always refer to China as ""China"" or ""People's Republic of 
              China,"" never as ""Red China,"" ""Communist China"" or ""Mainland 
              China."""
China,The People,"Always refer to Taiwan as ""Taiwan"" or ""Province of Taiwan,"" 
              never ""China,"" ""Republic of China"" (the name adapted by the 
              Nationalist forces after they fled to Taiwan) or ""Free China."""
China,The People,Do not in any way suggest that Taiwan is not part of China.
China,The People,"Show respect for older people. Offer a seat or right of way 
              through the door to a colleague or older person as a polite 
              gesture."
China,The People,Return applause when applauded.
China,The People,"Refrain from being loud, boisterous or showy."
China,The People,"Do not be insulted if the Chinese ask personal questions such 
              as ""How much money do you make?"" ""How many children do you have?"" 
              or ""Are you married?"" Just change the subject if you do not want 
              to answer."
China,The People,"Asking about divorce would cause a Chinese person to lose 
              face."
China,The People,"Forcing the Chinese to say ""no"" will quickly end a 
              relationship."
China,The People,"Never say or act like you are starving and don’t ask for a 
              doggy bag."
China,The People,"Most Chinese women don't wear wedding rings. Don't assume 
              marital status."
China,The People,Especially for Women
China,The People,"China is a difficult place for anyone to conduct business. A 
              woman may gain acceptance, but it will take time and will not be 
              easy."
China,The People,"China is a male-dominated society. However, there are many 
              women in business in China and some occupy high-ranking positions 
              and important managerial jobs. One of the principles of the 
              Chinese communist system is to work toward sexual equality."
China,The People,"Negotiating teams may have women members. Women may be used to 
              decline unpopular proposals."
China,The People,"Businesswomen attend business dinners, but rarely bring their 
              spouses."
China,The People,"Chinese women rarely smoke or drink. However, it is acceptable 
              for Western women to do so moderately."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Shake hands upon meeting. Chinese may nod or bow instead of 
              shaking hands, although shaking hands has become increasingly 
              common."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"When introduced to a Chinese group, they may greet you with 
              applause. Applaud back."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Senior persons begin greetings. Greet the oldest, most senior 
              person before others. During group introductions, line up 
              according to seniority with the senior person at the head of the 
              line."
China,Meeting and Greeting,Names and Titles
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Use family names and appropriate titles until specifically 
              invited by your Chinese host or colleagues to use their given 
              names."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Address the Chinese by Mr., Mrs., Miss plus family name. Note: 
              married women always retain their maiden name."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Chinese are often addressed by their government or 
              professional titles. For example, address Li Pang using his title: 
              Mayor Li or Director Li."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Names may have two parts; for example: Wang Chien. Traditional 
              Chinese family names are placed first with the given name (which 
              has one or two syllables) coming last (family name: Wang; given: 
              Chien)."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Chinese generally introduce their guests using their full 
              titles and company names. You should do the same. Example: Doctor 
              John Smith, CEO of American Data Corporation."
China,Meeting and Greeting,Body Language
China,Meeting and Greeting,"The Chinese dislike being touched by strangers. Do not touch, 
              hug, lock arms, back slap or make any body contact."
China,Meeting and Greeting,Clicking fingers or whistling is considered very rude.
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Never put your feet on a desk or a chair. Never gesture or 
              pass an object with your feet."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Blowing one's nose in a handkerchief and returning it to one's 
              pocket is considered vulgar by the Chinese."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"To beckon a Chinese person, face the palm of your hand 
              downward and move your fingers in a scratching motion. Never use 
              your index finger to beckon anyone."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Sucking air in quickly and loudly through lips and teeth 
              expresses distress or surprise at a proposed request. Attempt to 
              change your request, allowing the Chinese to save face."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Chinese point with an open hand. Never point with your index 
              finger."
China,Meeting and Greeting,Corporate Culture
China,Meeting and Greeting,"The Chinese are practical in business and realize they need 
            Western investment, but dislike dependency on foreigners. They are 
            suspicious and fearful of being cheated or pushed around by 
            foreigners, who are perceived as culturally and economically 
            corrupt. It is very difficult to break through the ""them vs. us"" 
            philosophy (foreign partner vs. Chinese). In personal relationships, 
            the Chinese will offer friendship and warm hospitality without 
            conflict, but in business they are astute negotiators."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Punctuality is important for foreign businesspeople. Being 
              late is rude. Meetings always begin on time."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Business cards are exchanged upon meeting. Business cards 
              should be printed in English on one side and Chinese on the other. 
              Make sure the Chinese side uses ""simplified"" characters and not 
              ""classical"" characters, which are used in Taiwan and Hong Kong."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"English is not spoken in business meetings, although some 
              Chinese may understand English without making it known. Hire an 
              interpreter or ask for one to be provided."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Be prepared for long meetings and lengthy negotiations (often 
              ten days straight) with many delays."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"The Chinese will enter a meeting with the highest-ranking 
              person entering first. They will assume the first member of your 
              group to enter the room is the leader of your delegation. The 
              senior Chinese person welcomes everyone. The foreign leader 
              introduces his/her team, and each member distributes his/her card. 
              The leader invites the Chinese to do the same."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Seating is very important at a meeting. The host sits to the 
              left of the most important guest."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"There may be periods of silence at a business meeting; do not 
              interrupt these."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"A contract is considered a draft subject to change. Chinese 
              may agree on a deal and then change their minds. A signed contract 
              is not binding and does not mean negotiations will end."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Observing seniority and rank are extremely important in 
              business."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"The status of the people who make the initial contact with the 
              Chinese is very important. Don't insult the Chinese by sending 
              someone with a low rank."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Chinese negotiators may try to make foreign negotiators feel 
              guilty about setbacks; they may then manipulate this sense of 
              guilt to achieve certain concessions."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Two Chinese negotiating tricks designed to make you agree to 
              concessions are staged temper tantrums and a feigned sense of 
              urgency."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"If the Chinese side no longer wishes to pursue the deal, they 
              may not tell you. To save their own face, they may become 
              increasingly inflexible and hard-nosed, forcing you to break off 
              negotiations. In this way, they may avoid blame for the failure."
China,Meeting and Greeting,Dining and Entertainment
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Dining is used to probe positions without any formal 
              commitment. Business is generally not discussed during meals. 
              Meals are a vehicle for indirect business references."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"The Chinese are superb hosts. Twelve-course banquets with 
              frequent toasts are a Chinese trademark."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"The Chinese sponsoring organization generally hosts a 
              welcoming banquet. Foreign guests should reciprocate toward the 
              end of their visits. Invite everyone with whom you have dealt."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Always arrive exactly on time for a banquet. Never arrive 
              early for dinner. This implies that you are hungry and might cause 
              you to lose face."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Spouses are not usually included in business entertaining, 
              however, businesspeople may bring their secretaries."
China,Meeting and Greeting,Be prepared to make a small toast for all occasions.
China,Meeting and Greeting,"The first toast normally occurs during or after the first 
              course, not before. After the next course, the guest should 
              reciprocate."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Three glasses -- a large one for beer, soda or mineral water, 
              a small wine glass and a stemmed shot glass -- are at each place 
              setting. The shot glass is the one used for toasting."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"It is not necessary to always drain your glass after a ganbei 
              (bottoms up), although a host should encourage it."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Do not drink until you toast others at the table. Chinese 
              consider drinking alone to be rude. Simply raising your glass and 
              making eye contact is sufficient. If you are toasted, sip your 
              drink in reply."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"A toast to friendship among companies will help cement a 
              business relationship."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Unless you are totally drunk, it is not advised to refuse a 
              drink. Sipping your drink is perfectly acceptable."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Leave some food on your plate during each course of a meal to 
              honor the generosity of your host. It is bad manners for a Chinese 
              host not to keep refilling guests' plates or teacups."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Seating is very important. The guest of honor is always placed 
              at the head of the room, facing the door. Allow the host to begin 
              eating before joining in."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Do not discuss business at dinner unless your Chinese 
              counterpart initiates it."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Slurping soup and belching are acceptable. Cover your mouth 
              with your hand when using a toothpick. Put bones, seeds, etc. on 
              the table, never in your rice bowl."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Chopsticks are used for all meals. Tapping your chopsticks on 
              the table is considered very rude."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"When finished eating, place your chopsticks neatly on the 
              table or on the chopstick rest."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"When hosting, order one dish for every person present and one 
              extra. In addition, order rice, noodles and buns. Soup usually 
              comes at some point during the meal. The host should tell his/her 
              guests to begin eating a new dish before he digs in himself."
China,Meeting and Greeting,The host (the one who invites) pays the bill for everyone.
China,Meeting and Greeting,"If you are the guest of honor at a dinner, leave shortly after 
              the meal is finished, as no one will leave before the guest of 
              honor."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Breakfast meetings are rare, but you may request one."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Guests are rarely invited to a Chinese home. It is an honor to 
              be a guest. Be on time or a little early for an invitation, and 
              take a small gift."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Bedrooms and kitchens are private. Don't enter these rooms 
              unless you are invited to do so."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"All dishes are served at once in a home. The host will place 
              portions of each dish on guests' plates. Sample each dish."
China,Meeting and Greeting,Rare beef is considered barbaric by the Chinese.
China,Meeting and Greeting,Dress
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Conservative, simple, unpretentious, modest clothing should be 
              worn -- nothing flashy or overly fashionable."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Women should avoid bare backs, shorts, low-cut tops and 
              excessive jewelry."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"For business, men should wear sport coats and ties. Slacks and 
              open-necked shirts are generally suitable in the summer for 
              business meetings; jackets and ties are not necessary."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Women should wear dresses or pantsuits for business and should 
              avoid heavy make-up and dangling, gaudy jewelry."
China,Meeting and Greeting,Gifts
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Present a gift with both hands. Gifts are generally not opened 
              upon receiving. Always give a gift to everyone present or don't 
              give gifts at all."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Older Chinese usually refuse a gift at first to be polite. 
              Offer a second time."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Never give a gift of great value until a clear relationship is 
              established. This would cause embarrassment and may not be 
              accepted. Never give gifts in sets (i.e., dishes), but never in 
              sets of four (a number associated with death)."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Avoid white, which is symbolic of death, especially of 
              parents, and black, which symbolizes tragedy or death."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"When invited to someone's home, always bring a small gift for 
              the hostess, such as brandy, chocolates or cakes."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Be prepared to exchange a modest gift with your business 
              colleagues at the first meeting. Not giving a gift could start a 
              business meeting off on the wrong foot."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Always give gifts to each member of the Chinese delegation 
              that meets you in the order in which they were introduced. 
              Suggested gifts: cigarettes (especially Marlboro and Kent), French 
              brandy, whiskey, pens, lighters, desk attire, cognac, books, 
              framed paintings. Give more valuable gifts — like cellular phones 
              or small CD players — to senior level people."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Give a group gift from your company to the host company. 
              Present this gift to the leader of the delegation."
China,Meeting and Greeting,Helpful Hints
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Chinese find ""no"" difficult to say. They may say ""maybe"" or 
              ""we'll see"" in order to save face."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Always refer to China as ""China"" or ""People's Republic of 
              China,"" never as ""Red China,"" ""Communist China"" or ""Mainland 
              China."""
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Always refer to Taiwan as ""Taiwan"" or ""Province of Taiwan,"" 
              never ""China,"" ""Republic of China"" (the name adapted by the 
              Nationalist forces after they fled to Taiwan) or ""Free China."""
China,Meeting and Greeting,Do not in any way suggest that Taiwan is not part of China.
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Show respect for older people. Offer a seat or right of way 
              through the door to a colleague or older person as a polite 
              gesture."
China,Meeting and Greeting,Return applause when applauded.

              to answer."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Asking about divorce would cause a Chinese person to lose 
              face."

              consider drinking alone to be rude. Simply raising your glass and 
              making eye contact is sufficient. If you are toasted, sip your 
              drink in reply."
China,Names and Titles,"A toast to friendship among companies will help cement a 
              business relationship."

China,Names and Titles,"Leave some food on your plate during each course of a meal to 
              honor the generosity of your host. It is bad manners for a Chinese 
              host not to keep refilling guests' plates or teacups."
China,Names and Titles,"Seating is very important. The guest of honor is always placed 
              at the head of the room, facing the door. Allow the host to begin

China,Names and Titles,"Do not discuss business at dinner unless your Chinese 
              counterpart initiates it."

              the table, never in your rice bowl."
China,Names and Titles,"Chopsticks are used for all meals. Tapping your chopsticks on 
              the table is considered very rude."

              table or on the chopstick rest."
China,Names and Titles,"When hosting, order one dish for every person present and one 
              extra. In addition, order rice, noodles and buns. Soup usually

              guests to begin eating a new dish before he digs in himself."
China,Names and Titles,The host (the one who invites) pays the bill for everyone.
China,Names and Titles,"If you are the guest of honor at a dinner, leave shortly after

China,Names and Titles,"Breakfast meetings are rare, but you may request one."
China,Names and Titles,"Guests are rarely invited to a Chinese home. It is an honor to

China,Names and Titles,"Women should avoid bare backs, shorts, low-cut tops and 
              excessive jewelry."
China,Names and Titles,"For business, men should wear sport coats and ties. Slacks and

China,Names and Titles,"Women should wear dresses or pantsuits for business and should 
              avoid heavy make-up and dangling, gaudy jewelry."
China,Names and Titles,Gifts

              Offer a second time."
China,Names and Titles,"Never give a gift of great value until a clear relationship is 
              established. This would cause embarrassment and may not be

              sets of four (a number associated with death)."

              the hostess, such as brandy, chocolates or cakes."
China,Names and Titles,"Be prepared to exchange a modest gift with your business

China,Names and Titles,"Always give gifts to each member of the Chinese delegation 
              that meets you in the order in which they were introduced.

              brandy, whiskey, pens, lighters, desk attire, cognac, books,

              Present this gift to the leader of the delegation."

              China,"" never as ""Red China,"" ""Communist China"" or ""Mainland 
              China."""

China,Names and Titles,Especially for Women
China,Names and Titles,"China is a difficult place for anyone to conduct business. A 
              woman may gain acceptance, but it will take time and will not be 
              easy."
China,Names and Titles,"China is a male-dominated society. However, there are many 
              women in business in China and some occupy high-ranking positions 
              and important managerial jobs. One of the principles of the 
              Chinese communist system is to work toward sexual equality."

              decline unpopular proposals."
China,Names and Titles,"Businesswomen attend business dinners, but rarely bring their

              your index finger to beckon anyone."
China,Body Language,"Sucking air in quickly and loudly through lips and teeth 
              expresses distress or surprise at a proposed request. Attempt to 
              change your request, allowing the Chinese to save face."
China,Body Language,"Chinese point with an open hand. Never point with your index 
              finger."
China,Body Language,Corporate Culture
China,Body Language,"The Chinese are practical in business and realize they need 
            Western investment, but dislike dependency on foreigners. They are 
            suspicious and fearful of being cheated or pushed around by 
            foreigners, who are perceived as culturally and economically 
            corrupt. It is very difficult to break through the ""them vs. us"" 
            philosophy (foreign partner vs. Chinese). In personal relationships, 
            the Chinese will offer friendship and warm hospitality without 
            conflict, but in business they are astute negotiators."
China,Body Language,"Punctuality is important for foreign businesspeople. Being 
              late is rude. Meetings always begin on time."
China,Body Language,"Business cards are exchanged upon meeting. Business cards 
              should be printed in English on one side and Chinese on the other. 
              Make sure the Chinese side uses ""simplified"" characters and not 
              ""classical"" characters, which are used in Taiwan and Hong Kong."
China,Body Language,"English is not spoken in business meetings, although some 
              Chinese may understand English without making it known. Hire an 
              interpreter or ask for one to be provided."
China,Body Language,"Be prepared for long meetings and lengthy negotiations (often 
              ten days straight) with many delays."
China,Body Language,"The Chinese will enter a meeting with the highest-ranking 
              person entering first. They will assume the first member of your 
              group to enter the room is the leader of your delegation. The 
              senior Chinese person welcomes everyone. The foreign leader 
              introduces his/her team, and each member distributes his/her card. 
              The leader invites the Chinese to do the same."
China,Body Language,"Seating is very important at a meeting. The host sits to the 
              left of the most important guest."
China,Body Language,"There may be periods of silence at a business meeting; do not 
              interrupt these."
China,Body Language,"A contract is considered a draft subject to change. Chinese 
              may agree on a deal and then change their minds. A signed contract 
              is not binding and does not mean negotiations will end."
China,Body Language,"Observing seniority and rank are extremely important in 
              business."
China,Body Language,"The status of the people who make the initial contact with the 
              Chinese is very important. Don't insult the Chinese by sending 
              someone with a low rank."
China,Body Language,"Chinese negotiators may try to make foreign negotiators feel 
              guilty about setbacks; they may then manipulate this sense of 
              guilt to achieve certain concessions."
China,Body Language,"Two Chinese negotiating tricks designed to make you agree to 
              concessions are staged temper tantrums and a feigned sense of 
              urgency."
China,Body Language,"If the Chinese side no longer wishes to pursue the deal, they 
              may not tell you. To save their own face, they may become 
              increasingly inflexible and hard-nosed, forcing you to break off 
              negotiations. In this way, they may avoid blame for the failure."
China,Body Language,Dining and Entertainment
China,Body Language,"Dining is used to probe positions without any formal 
              commitment. Business is generally not discussed during meals. 
              Meals are a vehicle for indirect business references."

              frequent toasts are a Chinese trademark."
China,Body Language,"The Chinese sponsoring organization generally hosts a 
              welcoming banquet. Foreign guests should reciprocate toward the 
              end of their visits. Invite everyone with whom you have dealt."
China,Body Language,"Always arrive exactly on time for a banquet. Never arrive 
              early for dinner. This implies that you are hungry and might cause 
              you to lose face."
China,Body Language,"Spouses are not usually included in business entertaining, 
              however, businesspeople may bring their secretaries."
China,Body Language,Be prepared to make a small toast for all occasions.
China,Body Language,"The first toast normally occurs during or after the first 
              course, not before. After the next course, the guest should 
              reciprocate."
China,Body Language,"Three glasses -- a large one for beer, soda or mineral water, 
              a small wine glass and a stemmed shot glass -- are at each place 
              setting. The shot glass is the one used for toasting."
China,Body Language,"It is not necessary to always drain your glass after a ganbei 
              (bottoms up), although a host should encourage it."
China,Body Language,"Do not drink until you toast others at the table. Chinese 
              consider drinking alone to be rude. Simply raising your glass and 
              making eye contact is sufficient. If you are toasted, sip your

              guilt to achieve certain concessions."
China,Corporate Culture,"Two Chinese negotiating tricks designed to make you agree to 
              concessions are staged temper tantrums and a feigned sense of 
              urgency."
China,Corporate Culture,"If the Chinese side no longer wishes to pursue the deal, they 
              may not tell you. To save their own face, they may become 
              increasingly inflexible and hard-nosed, forcing you to break off 
              negotiations. In this way, they may avoid blame for the failure."
China,Corporate Culture,Dining and Entertainment
China,Corporate Culture,"Dining is used to probe positions without any formal 
              commitment. Business is generally not discussed during meals. 
              Meals are a vehicle for indirect business references."
China,Corporate Culture,"The Chinese are superb hosts. Twelve-course banquets with 
              frequent toasts are a Chinese trademark."
China,Corporate Culture,"The Chinese sponsoring organization generally hosts a 
              welcoming banquet. Foreign guests should reciprocate toward the 
              end of their visits. Invite everyone with whom you have dealt."
China,Corporate Culture,"Always arrive exactly on time for a banquet. Never arrive 
              early for dinner. This implies that you are hungry and might cause 
              you to lose face."
China,Corporate Culture,"Spouses are not usually included in business entertaining, 
              however, businesspeople may bring their secretaries."
China,Corporate Culture,Be prepared to make a small toast for all occasions.
China,Corporate Culture,"The first toast normally occurs during or after the first 
              course, not before. After the next course, the guest should 
              reciprocate."
China,Corporate Culture,"Three glasses -- a large one for beer, soda or mineral water, 
              a small wine glass and a stemmed shot glass -- are at each place 
              setting. The shot glass is the one used for toasting."
China,Corporate Culture,"It is not necessary to always drain your glass after a ganbei 
              (bottoms up), although a host should encourage it."
China,Corporate Culture,"Do not drink until you toast others at the table. Chinese 
              consider drinking alone to be rude. Simply raising your glass and 
              making eye contact is sufficient. If you are toasted, sip your 
              drink in reply."
China,Corporate Culture,"A toast to friendship among companies will help cement a 
              business relationship."
China,Corporate Culture,"Unless you are totally drunk, it is not advised to refuse a 
              drink. Sipping your drink is perfectly acceptable."
China,Corporate Culture,"Leave some food on your plate during each course of a meal to 
              honor the generosity of your host. It is bad manners for a Chinese 
              host not to keep refilling guests' plates or teacups."
China,Corporate Culture,"Seating is very important. The guest of honor is always placed 
              at the head of the room, facing the door. Allow the host to begin 
              eating before joining in."
China,Corporate Culture,"Do not discuss business at dinner unless your Chinese 
              counterpart initiates it."
China,Corporate Culture,"Slurping soup and belching are acceptable. Cover your mouth 
              with your hand when using a toothpick. Put bones, seeds, etc. on 
              the table, never in your rice bowl."
China,Corporate Culture,"Chopsticks are used for all meals. Tapping your chopsticks on 
              the table is considered very rude."
China,Corporate Culture,"When finished eating, place your chopsticks neatly on the 
              table or on the chopstick rest."
China,Corporate Culture,"When hosting, order one dish for every person present and one 
              extra. In addition, order rice, noodles and buns. Soup usually 
              comes at some point during the meal. The host should tell his/her 
              guests to begin eating a new dish before he digs in himself."
China,Corporate Culture,The host (the one who invites) pays the bill for everyone.
China,Corporate Culture,"If you are the guest of honor at a dinner, leave shortly after 
              the meal is finished, as no one will leave before the guest of 
              honor."
China,Corporate Culture,"Breakfast meetings are rare, but you may request one."
China,Corporate Culture,"Guests are rarely invited to a Chinese home. It is an honor to 
              be a guest. Be on time or a little early for an invitation, and 
              take a small gift."
China,Corporate Culture,"Bedrooms and kitchens are private. Don't enter these rooms 
              unless you are invited to do so."
China,Corporate Culture,"All dishes are served at once in a home. The host will place 
              portions of each dish on guests' plates. Sample each dish."
China,Corporate Culture,Rare beef is considered barbaric by the Chinese.
China,Corporate Culture,Dress
China,Corporate Culture,"Conservative, simple, unpretentious, modest clothing should be 
              worn -- nothing flashy or overly fashionable."
China,Corporate Culture,"Women should avoid bare backs, shorts, low-cut tops and 
              excessive jewelry."
China,Corporate Culture,"For business, men should wear sport coats and ties. Slacks and 
              open-necked shirts are generally suitable in the summer for 
              business meetings; jackets and ties are not necessary."
China,Corporate Culture,"Women should wear dresses or pantsuits for business and should 
              avoid heavy make-up and dangling, gaudy jewelry."
China,Corporate Culture,Gifts
China,Corporate Culture,"Present a gift with both hands. Gifts are generally not opened 
              upon receiving. Always give a gift to everyone present or don't 
              give gifts at all."
China,Corporate Culture,"Older Chinese usually refuse a gift at first to be polite. 
              Offer a second time."
China,Corporate Culture,"Never give a gift of great value until a clear relationship is 
              established. This would cause embarrassment and may not be 
              accepted. Never give gifts in sets (i.e., dishes), but never in 
              sets of four (a number associated with death)."
China,Corporate Culture,"Avoid white, which is symbolic of death, especially of 
              parents, and black, which symbolizes tragedy or death."
China,Corporate Culture,"When invited to someone's home, always bring a small gift for 
              the hostess, such as brandy, chocolates or cakes."
China,Corporate Culture,"Be prepared to exchange a modest gift with your business 
              colleagues at the first meeting. Not giving a gift could start a 
              business meeting off on the wrong foot."
China,Corporate Culture,"Always give gifts to each member of the Chinese delegation 
              that meets you in the order in which they were introduced. 
              Suggested gifts: cigarettes (especially Marlboro and Kent), French 
              brandy, whiskey, pens, lighters, desk attire, cognac, books, 
              framed paintings. Give more valuable gifts — like cellular phones 
              or small CD players — to senior level people."
China,Corporate Culture,"Give a group gift from your company to the host company. 
              Present this gift to the leader of the delegation."

China,Corporate Culture,"Always refer to China as ""China"" or ""People's Republic of

China,Corporate Culture,"Show respect for older people. Offer a seat or right of way

              gesture."
China,Corporate Culture,Return applause when applauded.

              as ""How much money do you make?"" ""How many children do you have?"" 
              or ""Are you married?"" Just change the subject if you do not want 
              to answer."
China,Corporate Culture,"Asking about divorce would cause a Chinese person to lose 
              face."
China,Corporate Culture,"Forcing the Chinese to say ""no"" will quickly end a

China,Corporate Culture,Especially for Women
China,Corporate Culture,"China is a difficult place for anyone to conduct business. A 
              woman may gain acceptance, but it will take time and will not be 
              easy."
China,Corporate Culture,"China is a male-dominated society. However, there are many 
              women in business in China and some occupy high-ranking positions 
              and important managerial jobs. One of the principles of the 
              Chinese communist system is to work toward sexual equality."

              decline unpopular proposals."

China,Gifts,"Present a gift with both hands. Gifts are generally not opened 
              upon receiving. Always give a gift to everyone present or don't 
              give gifts at all."
China,Gifts,"Older Chinese usually refuse a gift at first to be polite. 
              Offer a second time."
China,Gifts,"Never give a gift of great value until a clear relationship is 
              established. This would cause embarrassment and may not be 
              accepted. Never give gifts in sets (i.e., dishes), but never in 
              sets of four (a number associated with death)."
China,Gifts,"Avoid white, which is symbolic of death, especially of 
              parents, and black, which symbolizes tragedy or death."
China,Gifts,"When invited to someone's home, always bring a small gift for 
              the hostess, such as brandy, chocolates or cakes."
China,Gifts,"Be prepared to exchange a modest gift with your business 
              colleagues at the first meeting. Not giving a gift could start a 
              business meeting off on the wrong foot."
China,Gifts,"Always give gifts to each member of the Chinese delegation 
              that meets you in the order in which they were introduced. 
              Suggested gifts: cigarettes (especially Marlboro and Kent), French 
              brandy, whiskey, pens, lighters, desk attire, cognac, books, 
              framed paintings. Give more valuable gifts — like cellular phones 
              or small CD players — to senior level people."
China,Gifts,"Give a group gift from your company to the host company. 
              Present this gift to the leader of the delegation."

              women in business in China and some occupy high-ranking positions

Colombia,The People,"Colombia has one of the most successful economies in South 
            America, despite adverse conditions and a very unequal distribution 
            of wealth. A small number of Colombians hold most of the country's 
            wealth and political power, but the middle and working classes are 
            growing in Colombia's cities. Colombians are hardworking and peace 
            loving. Politeness, proper behavior, good manners and courtesy are 
            valued. Colombians are very proud of their democracy and 
            independence. They do not like or want outside interference and want 
            to address internal challenges on their own."

Colombia,The People,"It is considered demeaning to beckon someone with your index

Colombia,The People,Corporate Culture
Colombia,The People,"Colombians are normally punctual in business, although they 
              may be up to a half-hour late. The best policy for foreign 
              businesspeople is to be punctual, but prepared to wait. Don't get 
              angry if a 12:00 p.m. appointment doesn't begin until 12:30 p.m. 
              Excuse yourself if you are late."
Colombia,The People,"“In an hour or two” may mean tomorrow or next week. “Tomorrow”

              later."
Colombia,The People,"Colombians want to know you personally before they do business 
              with you. You must develop a relationship with your counterparts 
              before they will consider you trustworthy."
Colombia,The People,"Always allow your Colombian counterparts to bring up the 
              subject of business. Be aware that this may take awhile. Meetings

              points and what was agreed upon."

Colombia,The People,"For business, men should wear dark suits, white shirts and 
              ties in the cities. In warmer areas, dress is less formal. Women

Colombia,The People,"Be prudent when you talk about drugs. Colombia is working with

Colombia,The People,"Men may flirt or make comments; simply ignore them. Women

Colombia,Body Language,Especially for Women
Colombia,Body Language,"A woman in the workforce is treated as any man, 
              notwithstanding special courtesy and manners."
Colombia,Body Language,"United States businesswomen are received well in Colombia and 
              will be treated in a businesslike manner, although perhaps with 
              some curiosity. North American women should not have trouble doing 
              business in Colombia."
Colombia,Body Language,"Men may flirt or make comments; simply ignore them. Women 
              should be careful not to do anything that might be considered 
              flirtatious, which may be misinterpreted."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"Colombians are normally punctual in business, although they 
              may be up to a half-hour late. The best policy for foreign 
              businesspeople is to be punctual, but prepared to wait. Don't get 
              angry if a 12:00 p.m. appointment doesn't begin until 12:30 p.m. 
              Excuse yourself if you are late."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"“In an hour or two” may mean tomorrow or next week. “Tomorrow” 
              seldom means tomorrow and may mean next week. Don't get offended

              later."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"Colombians want to know you personally before they do business 
              with you. You must develop a relationship with your counterparts 
              before they will consider you trustworthy."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"Always allow your Colombian counterparts to bring up the 
              subject of business. Be aware that this may take awhile. Meetings 
              may be slow, with quiet, deliberate discussions."

              points and what was agreed upon."

              Colombians prefer to do business in person -- one can only get “so 
              far” by phone and fax."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"Maintain eye contact during conversations, or you may leave a 
              bad impression."

            parents and teachers are greatly respected. Ecuador is one of the 
            most racially divided countries of South America. Whites (Blancos) 
            are better off economically and educationally than the rest of the 
            population. Mestizos are usually middle class. Native Ecuadorians 
            (Indios) are considered lower class, and many live in poverty, are 
            illiterate and often don't speak Spanish. Blacks have overcome many 
            stereotypes."

Hong Kong,The People,"Hong Kong is very sophisticated and cosmopolitan, blending the 
            cultures of Asia and Europe. Its people are highly educated, very 
            motivated and westernized. Hong Kong is 98% Chinese (Cantonese), but 
            the people view themselves as different from other Chinese. 
            Cantonese habits and customs are dominant. An individual's actions, 
            prestige, education, wealth and reputation reflect positively or 
            negatively on the entire family."
Hong Kong,The People,Meeting and Greeting
Hong Kong,The People,"Shake hands with everyone -- men, women and children -- upon 
              meeting and leaving. Note that Hong Kong Chinese handshakes may be 
              less firm than a Western handshake."
Hong Kong,The People,"Higher-ranking persons are introduced before those of lower 
              rank. An older person comes before a younger person, and a woman 
              before a man. Family members are greeted in order of age, oldest 
              first and youngest last."

              late for an appointment with you."
Hong Kong,The People,"Tea is served at meetings. Do not drink until your host takes 
              the first sip. A host leaving tea untouched signals the end of the 
              meeting."
Hong Kong,The People,"Bring business cards printed in English on one side and 
              Chinese on the other side. Make sure that the Chinese side uses 
              ""classical"" characters, the written form of Chinese used in Hong 
              Kong, and not ""simplified"" characters, which are used in the 
              People's Republic of China. Upon introduction, present your 
              business card with both hands and with the Chinese side up."

              you."

              Send senior people with technical and commercial expertise 
              prepared to function as a team and make decisions on the spot. 
              Business deals may be sealed with a handshake alone. Be prepared

Hong Kong,The People,"Banking contacts are very important. Use a bank to set up your 
              meetings."

Hong Kong,The People,"""Yes"" may not mean agreement; it often means ""I hear you."" 
              ""No"" is generally not said. Instead, you may hear ""I will have to 
              wait,"" or ""This may be very difficult."""
Hong Kong,The People,"Do not attempt to open an office in Hong Kong without hiring 
              or consulting a ""geomancer""/""feng shui"" professional. A feng shui 
              professional advises on facility, moving date, opening date, 
              entrance, etc. and positions office furniture to be in harmony 
              with cosmic forces. Do not ignore this custom. Many Chinese will 
              not do business without feng shui approval for fear of trouble 
              from spirits. Ask a Hong Kong businessperson for the name and 
              number of a reliable feng shui professional."
Hong Kong,The People,"Make appointments for business meetings a month before 
              arrival."

              will be refilled continually. Leave your cup full if you are 
              finished. Chinese find adding sugar and cream to tea a very 
              strange Western habit. Place teapot lid upside down (or open if 
              attached) to signal the waiter for more tea."
Hong Kong,The People,"Toasting is an important part of a Chinese dinner. If you are 
              the guest of honor and are toasted, smile, raise your glass, make 
              eye contact, drink, raise your glass and thank the host and 
              guests."
Hong Kong,The People,"The guest of honor rises and thanks the host for everyone 
              present at the end of dinner. Make a simple, polite, short toast 
              to friendship, success and cooperation."
Hong Kong,The People,"The banquet host visits each table and makes a toast. A toast 
              is often made in the middle of a banquet when the shark fin soup 
              is served."
Hong Kong,The People,"Be sure to eat and show appreciation for shark fin soup if it 
              is offered. This delicacy is offered only to special guests, and 
              is very expensive."
Hong Kong,The People,"It is bad manners for a host not to keep a guest's plate full, 
              and it is even worse for a guest not to continue eating as long as 
              the plate is full. Always leave some food on your dish after you 
              are finished with each course. Otherwise the host will continue 
              refilling your plate or bowl."
Hong Kong,The People,"Be sure to reciprocate with a banquet of equal quality. Your 
              hotel can assist you in preparations."
Hong Kong,The People,"Rice is served as a filler. Do not eat large amounts, which 
              implies the host has not served enough food."
Hong Kong,The People,"Lay your chopsticks on your chopstick rest or neatly on the 
              table when you are finished eating. Never stick them in a bowl of 
              rice."
Hong Kong,The People,"Don't be afraid to dirty the tablecloth. Bones, shells, etc. 
              are put on the table; do not put them in your rice bowl. A plate 
              may be provided for this purpose."
Hong Kong,The People,"The Chinese find belching, slurping, clanging utensils and 
              making loud noises at the dinner table acceptable, sometimes even

Hong Kong,The People,"Oranges or other fruits are served to signal the end of the 
              meal. Leave soon after the meal ends."

Hong Kong,The People,"Spouses are usually not included in business dining. Do not 
              bring a spouse unless invited to do so. If spouses are present, 
              business is generally not discussed."
Hong Kong,The People,Dress
Hong Kong,The People,"Hong Kong residents are very style-conscious and dress well. 
              Modesty and cleanliness are very important."
Hong Kong,The People,"All types of clothing are worn in Hong Kong. However, taste 
              and fashion look more toward Japan than Britain or the United 
              States. Clothing should be light for summer with sweaters and 
              jackets for winter."
Hong Kong,The People,"For business, men should wear conservative and lightweight 
              Western-style suits and ties. Women should wear conservative 
              dresses, suits or skirts and blouses."
Hong Kong,The People,Wear a good watch. It will be noticed.
Hong Kong,The People,"The Chinese tend to dress up when going out in the evening. 
              Most European-style hotel restaurants require a coat and tie in 
              the evening. Women should wear cocktail dresses or evening pants."
Hong Kong,The People,Gifts
Hong Kong,The People,"Gift giving is a tradition in Hong Kong that communicates 
              respect and friendship. Be prepared to present a small gift at the 
              first meeting, such as high-quality cognac, brandy, candy or pens. 
              Unlike other Asian countries, Scotch whiskey is not special in 
              Hong Kong."
Hong Kong,The People,Never go to a Chinese home without a gift.
Hong Kong,The People,"Present and receive a gift with both hands. Do not open a gift 
              upon receiving it."
Hong Kong,The People,"The word for the number ""3"" in Chinese sounds like the word 
              for ""life,"" and the word for the number ""8"" sounds like the word 
              for ""prosperity."" The Chinese word for number ""9"" is a homonym for 
              the word ""eternity."" Give gifts in these numbers, if possible. Do 
              not give gifts in a group of four; the Chinese word for ""4"" sounds 
              similar to the word for ""death."""
Hong Kong,The People,"Avoid giving white or red flowers (white is a symbol of 
              mourning, red is a symbol of blood); clocks are associated with 
              death, but watches are suitable gifts."
Hong Kong,The People,"Every conceivable product can be purchased in Hong Kong. Try 
              to bring something from your hometown or state."

              saying it."" You will have to learn to read between the lines."
Hong Kong,The People,Expect Hong Kong Chinese to ask personal questions.

              deny a compliment to show humility. Do not say thank you."
Hong Kong,The People,Do not speak loudly.
Hong Kong,The People,"You may be referred to as ""Gweilo"" (foreign devil). While 
              perhaps insulting, it is generally not a personal attack."
Hong Kong,The People,"Hong Kong Chinese are very superstitious; mentioning failure, 
              poverty or death offends them."

Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Banking contacts are very important. Use a bank to set up your 
              meetings."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Take time to build relationships. It may take several meetings 
              to accomplish goals. Do business face to face. Courtesy calls and 
              personal selling are vital to success."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"""Yes"" may not mean agreement; it often means ""I hear you."" 
              ""No"" is generally not said. Instead, you may hear ""I will have to 
              wait,"" or ""This may be very difficult."""
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Do not attempt to open an office in Hong Kong without hiring 
              or consulting a ""geomancer""/""feng shui"" professional. A feng shui 
              professional advises on facility, moving date, opening date, 
              entrance, etc. and positions office furniture to be in harmony 
              with cosmic forces. Do not ignore this custom. Many Chinese will 
              not do business without feng shui approval for fear of trouble 
              from spirits. Ask a Hong Kong businessperson for the name and 
              number of a reliable feng shui professional."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Make appointments for business meetings a month before 
              arrival."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,Dining and Entertainment
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Tea is the customary beverage for all occasions. Your teacup 
              will be refilled continually. Leave your cup full if you are 
              finished. Chinese find adding sugar and cream to tea a very 
              strange Western habit. Place teapot lid upside down (or open if 
              attached) to signal the waiter for more tea."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Toasting is an important part of a Chinese dinner. If you are 
              the guest of honor and are toasted, smile, raise your glass, make

              guests."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"The guest of honor rises and thanks the host for everyone 
              present at the end of dinner. Make a simple, polite, short toast 
              to friendship, success and cooperation."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"The banquet host visits each table and makes a toast. A toast 
              is often made in the middle of a banquet when the shark fin soup 
              is served."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Be sure to eat and show appreciation for shark fin soup if it 
              is offered. This delicacy is offered only to special guests, and 
              is very expensive."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"It is bad manners for a host not to keep a guest's plate full, 
              and it is even worse for a guest not to continue eating as long as 
              the plate is full. Always leave some food on your dish after you 
              are finished with each course. Otherwise the host will continue 
              refilling your plate or bowl."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Be sure to reciprocate with a banquet of equal quality. Your 
              hotel can assist you in preparations."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Rice is served as a filler. Do not eat large amounts, which 
              implies the host has not served enough food."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Lay your chopsticks on your chopstick rest or neatly on the 
              table when you are finished eating. Never stick them in a bowl of 
              rice."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Don't be afraid to dirty the tablecloth. Bones, shells, etc. 
              are put on the table; do not put them in your rice bowl. A plate

Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"The Chinese find belching, slurping, clanging utensils and

India,The People,"India is one of the most diverse countries in the world. It is a 
            sophisticated, modern, industrial leader that is home to many 
            primitive tribes and millions of poor people. Religion and language 
            separate people. The caste system limits social mobility (600,000 
            people belong to the lowest caste). Because of disparities in 
            distribution of wealth, a wide gap separates the few wealthy from 
            the many poor."
India,The People,Meeting and Greeting
India,The People,"Westerners may shake hands, however, greeting with 'namaste' 
              (na-mas-TAY) (placing both hands together with a slight bow) is 
              appreciated and shows respect for Indian customs."
India,The People,"Men shake hands with men when meeting or leaving. Men do not 
              touch women when meeting or greeting. Western women may offer 
              their hand to a westernized Indian man, but not normally to 
              others. Traditional Indian women may shake hands with foreign 
              women but not usually with men."
India,The People,Body Language
India,The People,Public displays of affection are not proper.
India,The People,"Indians generally allow an arm's length space between 
              themselves and others. Don't stand close to Indians. Indians value 
              personal space."
India,The People,"Indian men may engage in friendly back patting merely as a 
              sign of friendship."
India,The People,"When an Indian smiles and jerks his/her head backward -- a 
              gesture that looks somewhat like a Western ""no"" -- or moves his 
              head in a figure 8, this means ""yes."""
India,The People,"The Western side-to-side hand wave for ""hello"" is frequently 
              interpreted by Indians as ""no"" or ""go away."""
India,The People,"Use your right hand only to touch someone, pass money or pick 
              up merchandise. The left hand is considered unclean."
India,The People,Do not touch anyone's head. The head is considered sensitive.
India,The People,"Feet are considered unclean. Feet are sacred for holy men and 
              women. Pointing footwear at people is considered an insult."
India,The People,"Indians are very sensitive to being beckoned rudely. Hand and 
              arm waved up and down (Western ""good-bye"") means ""come here."" To 
              beckon, extend your arm, palm down and make a scratching motion 
              with fingers kept together."
India,The People,"Never point with a single finger or two fingers (used only

Indonesia,The People,"Along with unity and conformity to society's rules, honor and 
            respect for the individual is the basis of Indonesian culture. 
            Indonesians value loyalty to family and friends above all else. Life 
            is simple for most people; most enjoy few modern conveniences, such 
            as running water. Indonesia as a whole is viewed by its people as an 
            extended family with the president, schoolmasters and leaders of 
            business enterprises referred to as ""fathers"" by the public."
Indonesia,The People,Meeting and Greeting
Indonesia,The People,"Shake hands and give a slight nod when meeting for the first 
              time. After the first meeting, a handshake is not necessary; a 
              slight bow or nod of the head is sufficient. Shake an Indonesian 
              woman's hand only if she initiates the greeting."
Indonesia,The People,"Greet people with ""Selamat"" (sell-a-mat), which means peace. 
              Say it slowly and sincerely."
Indonesia,The People,Body Language
Indonesia,The People,"Good relationships involve a great deal of physical contact 
              and touching. But, foreigners should allow time to be accepted and 
              to develop good relationships before this is acceptable."
Indonesia,The People,"Indonesians are used to an overcrowded society; they tend to 
              ignore inadvertent invasions of space. Allowing for personal space 
              is a sign of respect."
Indonesia,The People,"A man does not touch a woman in public except to shake hands. 
              Do not display affection in public."
Indonesia,The People,"The head is where the spirit resides and is considered sacred. 
              Do not touch a person’s head."
Indonesia,The People,"Keep both feet on the floor when sitting. Do not cross your 
              legs, especially not with an ankle over the knee. Sitting with 
              good posture (rigid) and both feet on the floor is a sign of 
              respect. Don’t allow the bottom of your feet to face or point at 
              another person."
Indonesia,The People,"Looking someone straight in the eyes is considered staring. 
              Avoid prolonged eye contact, which may be viewed as a challenge

Indonesia,The People,"Point with your thumb, not your index finger. Never beckon 
              with one finger."
Indonesia,The People,"The left hand is considered unclean. Do not touch food, pass 
              or receive anything, touch anyone or point with your left hand."
Indonesia,The People,"Approval is sometimes shown with a pat on the shoulder, but 
              American-style backslapping is considered offensive."
Indonesia,The People,Corporate Culture
Indonesia,The People,"Westerners are expected to be punctual for business 
              appointments. Call if you are delayed. It is very common for 
              Indonesians to arrive late."
Indonesia,The People,"Present your business card to the receptionist immediately 
              upon arrival; otherwise, there could be long delays. Exchange 
              business cards when being introduced. Present and receive the card 
              slowly with much interest. Cards in English are acceptable."
Indonesia,The People,"Negotiations should start at the top of a corporation and then 
              move down to the operating level to discuss technical matters. 
              Later on, discussions will return once again to the top level of 
              the company."
Indonesia,The People,"It is best to conduct a first meeting with the highest ranking 
              person of a company. An introduction from a local associate or 
              bank representative is helpful."
Indonesia,The People,"Indonesians don't get right down to business. An initial 
              meeting may last 45-60 minutes without accomplishing much. After 
              this amount of time, the visitor should initiate leaving."
Indonesia,The People,"Patience is a necessity when doing business in Indonesia. 
              Business dealings are usually slow, long and frustrating. Business 
              relationships must be allowed to develop over time. Several visits 
              are generally necessary to complete a contract."
Indonesia,The People,"Indonesians love to bargain. Giving concessions too quickly 
              will be viewed as naivete."
Indonesia,The People,"Clarification and feedback are a necessity throughout 
              negotiations. Avoid disagreement and, especially, arguments with 
              Indonesians."
Indonesia,The People,"To Indonesians, insisting on a written contract is a breech of 
              trust, though many understand a Westerner’s need for such 
              documents. A contract should be viewed as a guideline rather than 
              a statement of duties and responsibilities."
Indonesia,The People,"Personal visits are important to Indonesians. They do not take 
              well to faxes, telephone calls or messages. Show up in person 
              whenever possible."
Indonesia,The People,"Indonesians want very much to please. An untruthful answer may 
              be given so as not to disappoint anyone."
Indonesia,The People,"Indonesians rarely disagree in public. To succeed in 
              negotiations with Indonesians, do not apply pressure or be 
              confrontational."

              left hand and the spoon in the right. Use the fork to push food 
              onto the spoon."
Indonesia,The People,Most Indonesians are Muslim and consume no liquor or pork.
Indonesia,The People,"Indonesians are known for their hospitality. Do not reject 
              their hospitality, as it will be viewed as a personal rejection. 
              Never refuse food or drink, but never finish either completely. 
              Compliments about the food are appreciated. It is a special honor 
              to be invited to an Indonesian's home."
Indonesia,The People,"The host is always the last to sit and eat. Men are generally 
              served first. Wait to be invited to eat or drink."
Indonesia,The People,"The guest of honor or senior person begins the meal; this is a 
              distinct honor. If you are asked to begin the meal, you should 
              refuse twice and then begin."
Indonesia,The People,"Fingers are still used for eating in some places. Both hands 
              are kept above the table while eating."
Indonesia,The People,"The person who invites is expected to pay the bill in a 
              restaurant. Request the bill by making a scribbling gesture on the

Indonesia,The People,"When finished with the meal, place the fork (tines down) on 
              your plate with your spoon (down) crossed over the fork."
Indonesia,The People,"If possible, reciprocate with a dinner before you leave the 
              country. A lavish dinner may be criticized; be generous and 
              hospitable, but don't overdo it."
Indonesia,The People,Dress
Indonesia,The People,"Men should wear a suit and jacket for the first business 
              meeting."

              honored."
Indonesia,The People,Gifts
Indonesia,The People,"Business gifts are generally not exchanged. A small token of 
              appreciation may be given to secretaries. Gifts to colleagues 
              should be given after most business has been concluded."
Indonesia,The People,"Receive a gift appreciatively. It is impolite to refuse a 
              gift. Gifts are not opened in the giver's presence except at a 
              ceremony, where the gift is opened in front of an assembled group."

              may ask to take your picture."
Indonesia,The People,"Civil servants are respected. Be very respectful to government 
              workers. Never treat them as though they are your servants."
Indonesia,The People,"Don't assume tomorrow means tomorrow. Tomorrow may mean 
              sometime in the future. Set specific dates and times for 
              arrangements."
Indonesia,The People,Do not chew gum or yawn in public.
Indonesia,The People,Especially for Women
Indonesia,The People,"Indonesia is a Muslim society and very male-oriented, but most 
              female visitors experience very few hassles with men. However, 
              blond-haired, blue-eyed women may be hassled more often than dark 
              women. It helps if you dress modestly."
Indonesia,The People,"Businesswomen may invite an Indonesian businessman and his 
              wife to dinner. Arrange payment in advance to avoid embarrassment 
              (loss of face) to your male guest."
Indonesia,The People,A woman is expected to initiate a handshake.

Indonesia,Meeting and Greeting,Especially for Women
Indonesia,Meeting and Greeting,"Indonesia is a Muslim society and very male-oriented, but most 
              female visitors experience very few hassles with men. However, 
              blond-haired, blue-eyed women may be hassled more often than dark 
              women. It helps if you dress modestly."
Indonesia,Meeting and Greeting,"Businesswomen may invite an Indonesian businessman and his 
              wife to dinner. Arrange payment in advance to avoid embarrassment 
              (loss of face) to your male guest."
Indonesia,Meeting and Greeting,A woman is expected to initiate a handshake.
Indonesia,Body Language,"Good relationships involve a great deal of physical contact 
              and touching. But, foreigners should allow time to be accepted and 
              to develop good relationships before this is acceptable."
Indonesia,Body Language,"Indonesians are used to an overcrowded society; they tend to 
              ignore inadvertent invasions of space. Allowing for personal space 
              is a sign of respect."
Indonesia,Body Language,"A man does not touch a woman in public except to shake hands. 
              Do not display affection in public."
Indonesia,Body Language,"The head is where the spirit resides and is considered sacred. 
              Do not touch a person’s head."
Indonesia,Body Language,"Keep both feet on the floor when sitting. Do not cross your 
              legs, especially not with an ankle over the knee. Sitting with 
              good posture (rigid) and both feet on the floor is a sign of 
              respect. Don’t allow the bottom of your feet to face or point at 
              another person."
Indonesia,Body Language,"Looking someone straight in the eyes is considered staring. 
              Avoid prolonged eye contact, which may be viewed as a challenge 
              and may cause anger."
Indonesia,Body Language,"Point with your thumb, not your index finger. Never beckon 
              with one finger."

              or receive anything, touch anyone or point with your left hand."

              American-style backslapping is considered offensive."

              appointments. Call if you are delayed. It is very common for 
              Indonesians to arrive late."
Indonesia,Body Language,"Present your business card to the receptionist immediately 
              upon arrival; otherwise, there could be long delays. Exchange 
              business cards when being introduced. Present and receive the card 
              slowly with much interest. Cards in English are acceptable."
Indonesia,Body Language,"Negotiations should start at the top of a corporation and then 
              move down to the operating level to discuss technical matters. 
              Later on, discussions will return once again to the top level of 
              the company."
Indonesia,Body Language,"It is best to conduct a first meeting with the highest ranking 
              person of a company. An introduction from a local associate or 
              bank representative is helpful."
Indonesia,Body Language,"Indonesians don't get right down to business. An initial 
              meeting may last 45-60 minutes without accomplishing much. After 
              this amount of time, the visitor should initiate leaving."
Indonesia,Body Language,"Patience is a necessity when doing business in Indonesia. 
              Business dealings are usually slow, long and frustrating. Business 
              relationships must be allowed to develop over time. Several visits

              trust, though many understand a Westerner’s need for such 
              documents. A contract should be viewed as a guideline rather than 
              a statement of duties and responsibilities."
Indonesia,Body Language,"Personal visits are important to Indonesians. They do not take 
              well to faxes, telephone calls or messages. Show up in person 
              whenever possible."
Indonesia,Body Language,"Indonesians want very much to please. An untruthful answer may 
              be given so as not to disappoint anyone."
Indonesia,Body Language,"Indonesians rarely disagree in public. To succeed in 
              negotiations with Indonesians, do not apply pressure or be

Indonesia,Body Language,Most Indonesians are Muslim and consume no liquor or pork.
Indonesia,Body Language,"Indonesians are known for their hospitality. Do not reject 
              their hospitality, as it will be viewed as a personal rejection.

              to be invited to an Indonesian's home."
Indonesia,Body Language,"The host is always the last to sit and eat. Men are generally 
              served first. Wait to be invited to eat or drink."
Indonesia,Body Language,"The guest of honor or senior person begins the meal; this is a 
              distinct honor. If you are asked to begin the meal, you should 
              refuse twice and then begin."

              are kept above the table while eating."

            Education, ambition, hard work, patience and determination are held

              appreciated."
Japan,The People,"Japanese may exchange business cards even before they shake 
              hands or bow. Be certain your business card clearly states your 
              rank. This will determine who your negotiating counterpart should 
              be."

              management."
Japan,The People,"It is acceptable to use a Japanese company interpreter in the 
              first meeting. Once negotiations begin, hire your own interpreter."

              women and senior executives higher than junior executives."
Japan,The People,"It is very important to send a manager of the same rank to 
              meet with a Japanese colleague. Title is very important."

              strongly united with no competition; all succeed or all fail. 
              Decision-making is by consensus. Everyone on the work team must be 
              consulted before making decisions. This is a very slow process."
Japan,The People,"The first meeting may focus on establishing an atmosphere of 
              friendliness, harmony and trust. Business meetings are conducted

              polite conversation before beginning business meetings."

              comes, be content to close a deal with a handshake. Leave the 
              signing of the written contract to later meetings."
Japan,The People,"Etiquette and harmony are very important. ""Saving face"" is a 
              key concept. Japanese are anxious to avoid unpleasantness and 
              confrontation. Try to avoid saying ""no."" Instead, say, ""This could 
              be very difficult,"" allowing colleagues to save face."

Japan,The People,"Drinking is a group activity. Do not say ""no"" when offered a 
              drink."
Japan,The People,"An empty glass is the equivalent of asking for another drink. 
              Keep your glass at least half full if you do not want more. If a 
              Japanese person attempts to pour more and you do not want it, put 
              your hand over your glass, or fill it with water if necessary."
Japan,The People,"An empty plate signals a desire for more food. Leave a little 
              food on your plate when you are finished eating."
Japan,The People,"When drinking with a Japanese person, fill his glass or cup 
              after he has filled yours. While he is pouring, hold your cup or 
              glass up so he can fill it easily. Never pour your own drink and 
              always pour your companion's."
Japan,The People,"Toasting is very important in Japan and many toasts are 
              offered during the course of an evening. At dinner, wait for the 
              toast before you drink. Respond to each toast with a toast."
Japan,The People,"Wait for the most important person (honored guest) to begin 
              eating. If you are the honored guest, wait until all the food is 
              on the table and everyone is ready before you eat."
Japan,The People,"When offered food, it is polite to hesitate before accepting. 
              You do not have to eat much, but it is rude not to sample each 
              dish."

              it makes them taste better."

              finished eating."
Japan,The People,Dress

              the gift."
Japan,The People,"Allow your Japanese counterpart to initiate the gift giving.

              token,"" or ""This is an insignificant gift."""
Japan,The People,"It is very important to receive a gift properly. Give a gift

Japan,The People,"Do not give anyone a gift unless you have one for everyone

              Present a gift in a modest fashion, saying, ""This is just a small 
              token,"" or ""This is an insignificant gift."""
Japan,Corporate Culture,"It is very important to receive a gift properly. Give a gift 
              and receive a gift with both hands and a slight bow. The Japanese

Japan,Corporate Culture,"Non-Japanese women are treated very politely in business and 
              it is understood that Western women hold high-level positions in

              dinner. Allow your Japanese colleague to pick the restaurant."
Japan,Dining and Entertainment,"Restaurant entertaining is crucial to business. A person is 
              judged by his/her behavior during and after business hours. Seldom 
              is a business deal completed without dinner in a restaurant."
Japan,Dining and Entertainment,"Drinking is a group activity. Do not say ""no"" when offered a 
              drink."
Japan,Dining and Entertainment,"An empty glass is the equivalent of asking for another drink. 
              Keep your glass at least half full if you do not want more. If a 
              Japanese person attempts to pour more and you do not want it, put 
              your hand over your glass, or fill it with water if necessary."
Japan,Dining and Entertainment,"An empty plate signals a desire for more food. Leave a little 
              food on your plate when you are finished eating."
Japan,Dining and Entertainment,"When drinking with a Japanese person, fill his glass or cup 
              after he has filled yours. While he is pouring, hold your cup or 
              glass up so he can fill it easily. Never pour your own drink and 
              always pour your companion's."
Japan,Dining and Entertainment,"Toasting is very important in Japan and many toasts are 
              offered during the course of an evening. At dinner, wait for the 
              toast before you drink. Respond to each toast with a toast."
Japan,Dining and Entertainment,"Wait for the most important person (honored guest) to begin 
              eating. If you are the honored guest, wait until all the food is 
              on the table and everyone is ready before you eat."
Japan,Dining and Entertainment,"When offered food, it is polite to hesitate before accepting. 
              You do not have to eat much, but it is rude not to sample each 
              dish."
Japan,Dining and Entertainment,"It is acceptable to slurp noodles. Some Japanese believe that 
              it makes them taste better."

            policies make them second-class citizens; Malays support these 
            policies, which they feel are their only way to overcome traditional 
            dominance. The Chinese dominate the business community and live in

Mexico,The People,"Mexico is a very class-conscious society where social 
            stratifications are well-defined. Upper class Mexicans will not 
            dirty their hands with tasks they find beneath them. A sense of 
            fatalism is quite strong among many Mexicans, who feel that their 
            path through life is largely preordained. Macho attitudes are 
            inculcated in Mexican males almost from birth, and machismo plays a 
            pervasive role in shaping Mexican culture."
Mexico,The People,Meeting and Greeting
Mexico,The People,Shake hands or give a slight bow when introduced.
Mexico,The People,"Bow when greeting a Mexican woman. Shake hands only if she 
              extends her hand first."
Mexico,The People,Body Language
Mexico,The People,"Mexicans generally stand close together when conversing. Don't 
              show signs of discomfort, which would be considered rude by your 
              Mexican counterpart."
Mexico,The People,"Mexicans often ""hold"" a gesture (a handshake, a squeeze of the 
              arm, a hug) longer than Americans and Canadians do."
Mexico,The People,"Don't stand with your hands on your hips; this signifies 
              anger. It is considered rude to stand around with your hands in 
              your pockets."
Mexico,The People,Corporate Culture
Mexico,The People,"Punctuality is expected of foreign businesspeople. Your 
              Mexican counterpart may be late or keep you waiting. Thirty 
              minutes past the scheduled meeting time is considered punctual by 
              Mexicans."
Mexico,The People,"Spanish is the language of business. You may need to hire an 
              interpreter (preferably a native speaker who understands the 
              language as it is spoken in Mexico)."
Mexico,The People,"Meet with top executives first. Top-level Mexican executives 
              may not attend subsequent meetings, which often take place with 
              middle-level management and technical people. Don't feel insulted; 
              this shows that discussions are proceeding positively."
Mexico,The People,"Negotiations move slowly. Be patient. For Mexicans, the 
              building of a personal relationship comes before the building of a 
              professional one."
Mexico,The People,"Expect approximately ten to fifteen minutes of small talk 
              before getting down to business."
Mexico,The People,"If offered something to drink (usually coffee), don't refuse. 
              This would be seen as an insult."
Mexico,The People,"Take some time for consideration before agreeing to anything. 
              Quick decisiveness is often seen as hasty."

              You should always ask for written confirmation of any agreement or 
              commitment."
Mexico,The People,"Management or other important people may sometimes make 
              unreasonable or overly aggressive demands to demonstrate their 
              importance within or to their own group. Be aware of such hidden 
              agendas."
Mexico,The People,"Personalize everything. Explain how all proposals will benefit 
              a Mexican's country, community, family and, most important, the 
              Mexican personally."
Mexico,The People,"Deal-making almost never occurs over the phone (and rarely by 
              letter). Mexicans prefer to do business in person."
Mexico,The People,"Your local contact person or representative is very important 
              and should be chosen very carefully. A low-level representative 
              will be taken as an affront by status-conscious Mexicans, who will 
              assume that you are not really serious."
Mexico,The People,"The status of your hotel accommodations, the quality of your 
              clothes and watch, and whether or not you arrive in a chauffeured 
              limousine or in a taxi, etc. will be critically appraised by your 
              Mexican counterparts."
Mexico,The People,"Be persistent! Don't give up if you don't receive a response 
              to your phone calls or letters right away or if your meetings are 
              continually postponed or canceled. If you give up, your Mexican 
              counterparts might assume that you weren't serious in the first 
              place."

              eating."
Mexico,The People,"Drinking to excess is frowned upon in Mexico, especially when 
              it's done by women. Customarily, only men propose toasts; foreign 
              women normally shouldn't offer toasts."
Mexico,The People,"Don’t show up on time for a social engagement -- you will be 
              the only one who does, and will most likely be waiting for a very 
              long time (possibly hours)."
Mexico,The People,"To reciprocate, invite your Mexican counterparts to dinner at 
              a nice restaurant (French or Italian are your best bets). Pay in 
              advance to avoid arguments about the bill."
Mexico,The People,"Businesspeople are often invited to visit the home of their

              gifts include non-personal items with your corporate logo."
Mexico,The People,"Flowers should always be given when visiting a Mexican home. 
              It's OK to have them sent beforehand, or to bring them with you. 
              If you have them sent, make sure that they arrive before you do."
Mexico,The People,Helpful Hints
Mexico,The People,"Any attempt to speak Spanish is appreciated by your Mexican 
              counterparts and is seen as a gesture of goodwill. Demonstrating

Mexico,The People,"Mexicans are very proud of their independence and have a very 
              strong sense of national identity and pride. Never compare the way

              States."
Mexico,The People,"Deadlines are often little more than (very) general target 
              dates."
Mexico,The People,"Note differences in class and status in Mexico, for such 
              differences are important."

              greater extent than it would in the United States."
Mexico,The People,Especially for Women
Mexico,The People,"Women should prepare for some difficulty when doing business 
              in Mexico. Because some Mexican businessmen you encounter may not 
              have had many dealings with women in positions of authority, you 
              should demonstrate your competence, skill and authority."
Mexico,The People,"Talk and behavior considered sexist and inappropriate in the 
              United States may well have to be endured in Mexico."
Mexico,The People,"Mexican men, business colleagues included, will pay foreign 
              businesswomen many compliments and may even be flirtatious. 
              Graciously accept such banter -- it is usually done with the 
              utmost respect -- while firmly reminding your male Mexican 
              counterparts that you are a businesswoman."
Mexico,The People,"Foreign businesswomen should not invite Mexican businessmen to 
              dinner unless their spouses also come along. If invited out to 
              dinner or to socialize by a male Mexican colleague, a 
              businesswoman should make it clear that no opportunity for romance 
              exists. Appearances are important."

Mexico,Meeting and Greeting,"Mexicans often ""hold"" a gesture (a handshake, a squeeze of the 
              arm, a hug) longer than Americans and Canadians do."
Mexico,Meeting and Greeting,"Don't stand with your hands on your hips; this signifies 
              anger. It is considered rude to stand around with your hands in 
              your pockets."
Mexico,Meeting and Greeting,Corporate Culture
Mexico,Meeting and Greeting,"Punctuality is expected of foreign businesspeople. Your 
              Mexican counterpart may be late or keep you waiting. Thirty 
              minutes past the scheduled meeting time is considered punctual by 
              Mexicans."
Mexico,Meeting and Greeting,"Spanish is the language of business. You may need to hire an 
              interpreter (preferably a native speaker who understands the 
              language as it is spoken in Mexico)."
Mexico,Meeting and Greeting,"Meet with top executives first. Top-level Mexican executives 
              may not attend subsequent meetings, which often take place with 
              middle-level management and technical people. Don't feel insulted; 
              this shows that discussions are proceeding positively."
Mexico,Meeting and Greeting,"Negotiations move slowly. Be patient. For Mexicans, the 
              building of a personal relationship comes before the building of a 
              professional one."

              will be taken as an affront by status-conscious Mexicans, who will 
              assume that you are not really serious."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"The status of your hotel accommodations, the quality of your 
              clothes and watch, and whether or not you arrive in a chauffeured 
              limousine or in a taxi, etc. will be critically appraised by your 
              Mexican counterparts."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Be persistent! Don't give up if you don't receive a response 
              to your phone calls or letters right away or if your meetings are 
              continually postponed or canceled. If you give up, your Mexican 
              counterparts might assume that you weren't serious in the first 
              place."

Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Don’t show up on time for a social engagement -- you will be 
              the only one who does, and will most likely be waiting for a very 
              long time (possibly hours)."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"To reciprocate, invite your Mexican counterparts to dinner at 
              a nice restaurant (French or Italian are your best bets). Pay in 
              advance to avoid arguments about the bill."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Businesspeople are often invited to visit the home of their

              counterparts that you are a businesswoman."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Foreign businesswomen should not invite Mexican businessmen to

Netherlands,The People,"The Dutch society is egalitarian and modern. The people are 
            modest, tolerant, independent, self-reliant, and entrepreneurial. 
            They value education, hard work, ambition and ability. The Dutch 
            have an aversion to the nonessential. Ostentatious behavior is to be 
            avoided. Accumulating money is fine, but spending money is 
            considered something of a vice. A high style is considered wasteful 
            and suspect. The Dutch are very proud of their cultural heritage, 
            rich history in art and music and involvement in international 
            affairs."
Netherlands,The People,Meeting and Greeting
Netherlands,The People,"Shake hands with everyone present -- men, women, and children 
              -- at business and social meetings. Shake hands again when 
              leaving. Introduce yourself if no one is present to introduce you. 
              The Dutch consider it rude not to identify yourself."
Netherlands,The People,"The Dutch will shake hands and say their last name, not 
              ""Hello."" They also answer the telephone with their last name."
Netherlands,The People,"It is considered impolite to shout a greeting. Wave if 
              greeting someone from a distance."
Netherlands,The People,Body Language
Netherlands,The People,"The Dutch are reserved and don't touch in public or display 
              anger or extreme exuberance."
Netherlands,The People,"The Dutch value privacy and seldom speak to strangers. It is 
              more likely that they will wait for you to make the first move. 
              Don't be afraid to do so."
Netherlands,The People,The Dutch expect eye contact while speaking with someone.
Netherlands,The People,"Moving your index finger around your ear means you have a 
              telephone call, not ""you're crazy."" The crazy sign is to tap the 
              center of your forehead with your index finger. This gesture is 
              very rude."
Netherlands,The People,Corporate Culture
Netherlands,The People,"The Dutch take punctuality for business meetings very 
              seriously and expect that you will do likewise; call with an 
              explanation if you are delayed."
Netherlands,The People,"Lateness, missed appointments, postponements, changing the 
              time of an appointment or a late delivery deteriorates trust and 
              can ruin relationships."
Netherlands,The People,"Exchange business cards during or after conversation. No set 
              ritual exists. Business cards in English are acceptable."
Netherlands,The People,"The Dutch are extremely adept at dealing with foreigners. They 
              are the most experienced and most successful traders in Europe."
Netherlands,The People,"The Dutch tend to get right down to business. Business 
              negotiations proceed at a rapid pace."
Netherlands,The People,"Presentations should be practical, factual and never sloppy."
Netherlands,The People,"An individual's cooperation and trust are valued over 
              performance. One-upmanship is frowned upon."
Netherlands,The People,"The Dutch tend to be direct, giving straight ""yes"" and ""no"" 
              answers."
Netherlands,The People,"The Dutch are conservative and forceful and can be stubborn 
              and tough negotiators. They are willing to innovate or experiment, 
              but with minimal risk."
Netherlands,The People,"Companies are frugal and careful with money. Business is 
              profit-oriented with the bottom line being very important. 
              However, the Dutch are not obsessed with numbers."
Netherlands,The People,"Strategy is cautious and pragmatic, usually involving 
              step-by-step plans. Preparations are made to improvise the plan, 
              if needed. Strategy is clear and communicated to all levels."
Netherlands,The People,"In many companies the decision-making process is slow and 
              ponderous, involving wide consultation. Consensus is vital. The 
              Dutch will keep talking until all parties agree."
Netherlands,The People,"Once decisions are made, implementation is fast and efficient."
Netherlands,The People,"In the Netherlands, commitments are taken seriously and are 
              honored. Do not promise anything or make an offer you are not 
              planning to deliver on."
Netherlands,The People,Dining and Entertainment
Netherlands,The People,"To beckon a waiter or waitress, raise your hand, make eye 
              contact, and sayober (waiter) or mevrouw(waitress)."
Netherlands,The People,"It is appropriate to discuss business during lunch. Business 
              breakfasts are not very common."
Netherlands,The People,"Most business entertaining is done in restaurants, but the 
              Dutch do a fair amount of entertaining at home as well."
Netherlands,The People,"The Dutch will make it clear that you are their guest if they 
              intend to pay the bill, otherwise expect to ""go Dutch"" and pay 
              your fair share. No one will be embarrassed at splitting the bill."
Netherlands,The People,"Spouses are often included in a business dinner. Ask if your 
              host expects your spouse included in a business function. Business 
              is not generally discussed if spouses are present."
Netherlands,The People,"Dutch manners are frank -- no-nonsense informality combined 
              with strict adherence to basic etiquette."
Netherlands,The People,"Food does not play the major role in hospitality that it does 
              in many other cultures. It is not considered essential for making 
              someone feel welcome. Do not expect to be served a meal unless the 
              invitation specifically mentions a meal."
Netherlands,The People,"Men should wait until all women are seated before they sit. 
              Allow the hostess to start eating and drinking before you eat."

              be offered and it is polite to accept."
Netherlands,The People,"Keep your hands on the table at all times during a meal -- not 
              in your lap. However, take care to keep your elbows off the table."
Netherlands,The People,"Use knife and fork to eat all food including sandwiches, fruit 
              and pizza."
Netherlands,The People,"To signify that you would like more food or that you are not 
              finished, cross your knife and fork in the middle of your plate in 
              an X."
Netherlands,The People,"It is considered rude to leave the table during dinner (even 
              to go to the bathroom)."
Netherlands,The People,"When finished eating, place your knife and fork side by side 
              at the 5:25 position on your plate."
Netherlands,The People,"Parties may go very late. Plan to stay for an hour or so after

Paraguay,The People,"Paraguayans are traditional, conservative people who strive for 
            tranquility (tranquilidad). Paraguay has historically been 
            voluntarily isolated. In the 19th century, the government tried to 
            seal the borders in an attempt to become self-sufficient. More 
            recently, very strict government controls have isolated the people 
            from most outside information. Inflation, foreign debt and high 
            unemployment plague this young democracy. There is a large gap 
            between the rich and poor. A few elite families control nearly all 
            the resources, and economic opportunities are limited to urban 
            dwellers."
Paraguay,The People,Meeting and Greeting
Paraguay,The People,"Men and women always shake hands when greeting, even if they 
              have met earlier in the day."
Paraguay,The People,"Paraguayans kiss twice when meeting friends and family 
              members."
Paraguay,The People,Body Language
Paraguay,The People,"Good posture is important. Try to keep your feet on the floor, 
              and never prop them up on a piece of furniture."
Paraguay,The People,"A chin flick (rubbing your hand under your chin) means “I 
              don't know.”"
Paraguay,The People,Corporate Culture
Paraguay,The People,"Paraguayans may be late, but visitors are expected to be 
              punctual for business meetings. Business appointments often begin 
              10 to 20 minutes late."

Philippines,The People,"Filipinos are casual, fun loving, sensitive and hospitable 
            people. Personal and family honor are stressed, as well as dignity 
            and pride. Education is highly valued and families make great 
            sacrifices to educate their children. Hiya (shame) is instilled in 
            Filipinos at an early age. To be shamed is the greatest form of 
            disgrace."

Philippines,The People,"Men and women shake hands with everyone present at a business 
              meeting or social occasion and when saying ""goodbye."" Handshakes

              mouths. Raised eyebrows signify recognition and agreement."
Philippines,The People,"Laughter may convey pleasure or embarrassment; it is commonly 
              used to relieve tension."
Philippines,The People,"""Yes"" is signified by a jerk of the head upward. ""No"" is 
              signified by a jerk of the head down. Since the Filipinos rarely 
              say no, the non-verbal sign for ""no"" is sometimes accompanied by a 
              verbal yes, which would still indicate ""no."""
Philippines,The People,"Staring is considered rude and could be misinterpreted as a 
              challenge, but Filipinos may stare or even touch foreigners,

Philippines,The People,"Filipinos find it difficult to say ""no,"" disagree, reject or 
              be confrontational, especially when a superior is involved. Expect

              should be ignored."
Philippines,Body Language,"A foreign woman should not pay a bill for a Filipino 
              businessman. It would embarrass him and might harm the business 
              relationship."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Filipinos are relaxed about time. Meetings and appointments 
              often begin late. Foreigners are supposed to be on time."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"A personal introduction by a mutual friend or business 
              associate makes business arrangements much smoother."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Establishing a personal relationship is important to the 
              success of a business relationship. Trust and loyalty are central 
              to developing relationships. Insincerity is easily detected and 
              can ruin the relationship."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Filipinos often have a ""take it or leave it"" attitude when it 
              comes to selling prices. They may also may place less stress on 
              the absolute selling price and place more emphasis on percentages, 
              unit cost or rounded figures."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Casual conversation may precede business discussions during 
              meetings."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Negotiations and business deals move slowly. A third-party 
              go-between may be a good idea to relieve tension or give 
              criticism. Do not allow meetings to go too long. Filipinos love to 
              eat and their enthusiasm wanes when they are hungry."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Communication is indirect, truth is diplomatically presented, 
              manner is gentle, and the perception of the recipient is 
              considered in all communications. All communication should be 
              courteous, regardless of its content. The Filipino attempt to 
              please may result in many unfinished projects."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Filipinos find it difficult to say ""no,"" disagree, reject or 
              be confrontational, especially when a superior is involved. Expect 
              an ambiguous or indirect answer -- not to deceive, but rather to 
              please and avoid confrontation."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Face-to-face meetings are preferred. Written communications 
              might not be answered. Communication by mail or telephone is 
              unreliable at best."

Philippines,Corporate Culture,Dining and Entertainment

              discussions."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Filipinos may view a dinner/party invitation as just a passing 
              thought. They may answer ""yes,"" but not take an invitation 
              seriously. Phone to re-invite and remind. An R.S.V.P. may not be

            family is the basis of Portuguese life. Life is simple, especially

            weekends only."

Russia,The People,"Russia has had a long history of totalitarianism, which has 
            resulted in a rather fatalistic approach to living. The desire to 
            work individually under personal initiative was suppressed by the 
            Czarist and Communist states. With the advent of perestroika 
            (restructuring), the Soviet/Communist value system has been 
            scrapped, but the pace of reform has been slow and many are finding 
            it very difficult to adapt to the Western values of individualism 
            and profit maximization. Older Russians are generally quite 
            pessimistic and don't have much faith in a better life in the 
            future. Younger urban Russians have adopted a more Western outlook 
            on life."
Russia,The People,Meeting and Greeting
Russia,The People,"Initial greetings may come across as cool. Do not expect 
              friendly smiles."
Russia,The People,"A handshake is always appropriate (but not obligatory) when 
              greeting or leaving, regardless of the relationship. Remove your 
              gloves before shaking hands. Don't shake hands over a threshold 
              (Russian folk belief holds that this action will lead to an 
              argument)."
Russia,The People,Body Language
Russia,The People,"Russians are a very demonstrative people, and public physical 
              contact is common. Hugs, backslapping, kisses on the cheeks and 
              other expansive gestures are common among friends or acquaintances 
              and between members of the same sex."
Russia,The People,Russians stand close when talking.
Russia,The People,"Putting your thumb through your index and middle fingers or 
              making the ""OK"" sign are considered very rude gestures in Russia."
Russia,The People,Corporate Culture
Russia,The People,"Russians appreciate punctuality. Business meetings generally 
              begin on time."
Russia,The People,"Under Communism there were no incentives for bureaucrats to 
              perform well or to even be pleasant toward clients; this meant 
              that the usual answer to any question was ""No."" This practice is 
              still found in Russian society today, but ""No"" is usually not the 
              final word on an issue. One has to bargain and be persistent to 
              get what he or she wants."
Russia,The People,"Business cards are handed out liberally in Russia and are 
              always exchanged at business meetings. The ceremony of presenting 
              and receiving business cards is important. Don't treat it lightly."
Russia,The People,"Representatives of the Russian company or government body are 
              usually seated on one side of a table at meetings with guests on 
              the other side."
Russia,The People,"Your company should be represented by a specialized team of 
              experts. Presentations should be thoroughly prepared, detailed, 
              factual and short on ""salesmanship."""
Russia,The People,"Russians usually negotiate technical issues very competently, 
              directly and clearly but, being newcomers to capitalism, often do 
              not fully understand Western business practices and objectives. 
              You may have to explain the reasoning behind some of your demands."
Russia,The People,"Russians find it difficult to admit mistakes, especially 
              publicly. They also find it difficult to risk offending someone by 
              making requests or assertions."
Russia,The People,"Trying to do business in Russia over the telephone is 
              generally ineffective. The Russian telecommunications system is 
              inadequate, but improving quickly. The telex is widely used."
Russia,The People,"Personal relationships play a crucial role in Russian 
              business."
Russia,The People,"Business negotiations in Russia are lengthy and may test your 
              patience. Plan to be in for the long haul."
Russia,The People,No agreement is final until a contract has been signed.
Russia,The People,Dining and Entertainment
Russia,The People,"When dining in a restaurant, arrive on time."
Russia,The People,"Russians are great hosts and love entertaining guests in their 
              homes. They will often put more food on the table than can be 
              eaten to indicate there is an abundance of food (whether there is 
              or not). Guests who leave food on their plates honor their host. 
              It means they have eaten well."
Russia,The People,"If you're invited for dinner, don't make other plans for later 
              in the evening. You are expected to spend time socializing after 
              the meal."
Russia,The People,"An invitation to a Russian dacha (country home) is a great 
              honor."
Russia,The People,"Do not turn down offers of food or drink. Given Russian 
              hospitality, this can be difficult, but to decline such offers is 
              considered rude."
Russia,The People,"At formal functions, guests do not usually start eating until 
              the host has begun. At such functions, no one should leave until

Russia,The People,"After a toast, most Russians like to clink their glasses

Russia,The People,"Learn Russian! Learning the language is of incalculable value, 
              and is the best way to win friends for yourself, your company and 
              your country. If that simply isn't possible, try to learn at least 
              a few phrases in Russian. It doesn't have to be perfect; Russians 
              greatly appreciate any attempt by foreigners to speak their 
              language."
Russia,The People,"Never refer to a Russian as ""Comrade."""
Russia,The People,"Do not expect to find smoke-free areas anywhere. A standard

Russia,The People,Especially for Women
Russia,The People,"Women are initially regarded with skepticism and may have to 
              prove themselves. Before you visit, have a mutually respected 
              colleague send a letter introducing you. Your business cards 
              should clearly state your title and academic degree. If you

              encounter far fewer problems."
Russia,The People,"Be feminine. Allow men to open doors, light cigarettes, etc. 
              Even if you think such customs are antiquated or silly, respect 
              the cultural background of your Russian colleagues."
Russia,The People,"Foreign businesswomen can use their femininity to their 
              advantage. For fear of not appearing a gentleman, many Russian 
              businessmen may allow foreign businesswomen to get away with some 
              things (requests for meetings, favors, etc.) that foreign 
              businessmen aren't allowed."
Russia,The People,"A woman can invite a Russian businessman to lunch and pay the

              friendly smiles."
Russia,Meeting and Greeting,"A handshake is always appropriate (but not obligatory) when 
              greeting or leaving, regardless of the relationship. Remove your 
              gloves before shaking hands. Don't shake hands over a threshold

              that the usual answer to any question was ""No."" This practice is 
              still found in Russian society today, but ""No"" is usually not the

Russia,Meeting and Greeting,"Russians usually negotiate technical issues very competently, 
              directly and clearly but, being newcomers to capitalism, often do

              You may have to explain the reasoning behind some of your demands."
Russia,Meeting and Greeting,"Russians find it difficult to admit mistakes, especially

Russia,Corporate Culture,Especially for Women
Russia,Corporate Culture,"Women are initially regarded with skepticism and may have to

              colleague send a letter introducing you. Your business cards 
              should clearly state your title and academic degree. If you 
              establish your position and ability immediately, you will 
              encounter far fewer problems."
Russia,Corporate Culture,"Be feminine. Allow men to open doors, light cigarettes, etc.

              the cultural background of your Russian colleagues."
Russia,Corporate Culture,"Foreign businesswomen can use their femininity to their 
              advantage. For fear of not appearing a gentleman, many Russian 
              businessmen may allow foreign businesswomen to get away with some 
              things (requests for meetings, favors, etc.) that foreign 
              businessmen aren't allowed."
Russia,Corporate Culture,"A woman can invite a Russian businessman to lunch and pay the 
              bill, although it might be interpreted by some men as an 
              invitation to flirt."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"When dining in a restaurant, arrive on time."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"Russians are great hosts and love entertaining guests in their 
              homes. They will often put more food on the table than can be 
              eaten to indicate there is an abundance of food (whether there is 
              or not). Guests who leave food on their plates honor their host. 
              It means they have eaten well."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"If you're invited for dinner, don't make other plans for later 
              in the evening. You are expected to spend time socializing after 
              the meal."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"An invitation to a Russian dacha (country home) is a great 
              honor."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"Do not turn down offers of food or drink. Given Russian 
              hospitality, this can be difficult, but to decline such offers is 
              considered rude."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"At formal functions, guests do not usually start eating until 
              the host has begun. At such functions, no one should leave until 
              the guest of honor has left. If you are the guest of honor, do not 
              stay too late."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"Know your limits when drinking alcohol in Russia. Drinking is 
              often an all-or-nothing affair -- moderation is not understood."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"Toasts, which are sometimes lengthy and occasionally humorous, 
              are common. The host starts and the guests reply. Do not drink 
              until the first toast has been offered."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"After a toast, most Russians like to clink their glasses 
              together. Do not do so if you are drinking something 
              non-alcoholic."

Singapore,The People,"Singapore is a conglomeration of Chinese (76%), Malay (15%) and 
            Indian (6%) cultures. In the past, this racial mixture has lead to 
            some conflict. However, today most Singaporeans enjoy racial harmony 
            and national unity. Each group works hard to maintain its cultural 
            traditions while building a modern, cohesive society. Singaporeans 
            of the younger generation think of themselves as Singaporean first, 
            and as Chinese, Malay or Indian second."
Singapore,The People,Meeting and Greeting
Singapore,The People,"Shake hands with everyone present at a business meeting or 
              social occasion. Shake hands again when leaving. Your handshake 
              should be firm."
Singapore,The People,"Singaporeans may bow slightly as they shake your hand. Many 
              Westerners are generally taller than Singaporeans, so it would be 
              polite to give a small bow. A slight bow for Chinese or older 
              people is polite."
Singapore,The People,Body Language
Singapore,The People,"Never touch a person's or child's head. The head is considered 
              sacred."
Singapore,The People,"The foot is considered the lowest part of the body, and is 
              thought to be unclean. The foot should never be used to point at 
              someone, and you should never show the bottom of your feet. 
              Tapping your foot or fidgeting your legs denotes feebleness and 
              lack of interest. When crossing your legs, do so only by placing 
              one knee over the other."
Singapore,The People,"Raise your hand to get someone's attention. Never signal or 
              point at a person with the forefinger. Do not pound your first on 
              an open palm; this is obscene. The forearm jerk is a rude gesture."
Singapore,The People,Corporate Culture
Singapore,The People,"Westerners are expected to be punctual for social occasions 
              and business meetings. Call if you are delayed. Tardiness is 
              viewed as a sign of disrespect."
Singapore,The People,"Business cards are exchanged upon being introduced. Exchange 
              business cards with both hands after you are introduced."
Singapore,The People,"The government finances many of the large corporations in 
              Singapore. This bureaucratic system is known for its high 
              efficiency and corruption-free business style. Western-style 
              management is evident in large firms managed by Singaporeans."
Singapore,The People,"Personal contacts are important in business. It takes several 
              years to develop business relationships. Take time to know people 
              before discussing business."
Singapore,The People,"Singaporeans tend to get right down to business in meetings. 
              Singaporeans are fast-paced and can make decisions quickly."
Singapore,The People,"You are expected to deliver reports, correspondence, packages, 
              etc. when promised."
Singapore,The People,"Always talk straight and get right to the point with 
              Singaporeans. You can be direct when dealing with issues of money."
Singapore,The People,Dining and Entertainment
Singapore,The People,"Dinner is the most common form of business entertainment, but 
              it is a time to socialize and build relationships rather than 
              discuss business. Don't be surprised if business dinners are 
              scheduled for every night of the week. Most entertainment is done 
              in restaurants."
Singapore,The People,"Food is usually put on the table with all dishes served at 
              once and to be shared by all. Drinks and appetizers are uncommon, 
              though they are available in Western restaurants."
Singapore,The People,Allow the host to order all the dishes.
Singapore,The People,"Chinese may offer a banquet. A Westerner should always 
              reciprocate with a banquet of equal value before departing."
Singapore,The People,"Chinese use chopsticks for most food and porcelain spoons for 
              the liquid part of soup. Western style utensils are used, but are 
              not as common as chopsticks."
Singapore,The People,"Allow a Chinese host to invite you to start your meal and 
              begin eating before you start to eat."
Singapore,The People,"When finished with your meal, place chopsticks on the 
              chopstick rest (setting them on your plate means you are not 
              finished)."
Singapore,The People,"Be on time for dinner in a Malay home. The dinner is usually 
              served immediately with no drinks or appetizers beforehand."
Singapore,The People,"Indians always wash their hands before and after a meal. In a 
              Malay home, you will be given a small bowl of water and a towel. 
              Use the water to wash your hands."
Singapore,The People,"Malays and Indians use a spoon along with their hands to eat, 
              but never use your left hand to eat (unclean). If given a spoon 
              and fork, hold the spoon in your right hand and use your fork 
              (left hand) to push food onto the spoon."
Singapore,The People,"Never let the serving spoon touch your plate and never share 
              your leftovers. Indians believe that anything that touches 
              someone's plate is tainted."
Singapore,The People,"It is impolite to refuse initial offers of food or drink. To 
              refuse seconds, place your hand above your plate and say, ""No, 
              thank you."" When finished, place your spoon and fork together on 
              your plate. If they are not placed together, you will be offered 
              more food."
Singapore,The People,"After a meal with Indians, expect to stay for approximately 
              one hour of conversation."
Singapore,The People,Dress
Singapore,The People,"Due to different ethnic groups and the modern character of 
              Singaporeans, there are many different attires acceptable. Dress 
              is normally very casual. Western clothing is most common."
Singapore,The People,"For business, men should wear white shirts, tie and slacks. 
              Jackets are usually not required."
Singapore,The People,"Women should wear blouses with sleeves and skirts or 
              pantsuits."
Singapore,The People,Gifts
Singapore,The People,Each ethnic group shares different gift giving traditions.
Singapore,The People,Business gifts are generally not exchanged.
Singapore,The People,"Use both hands to give someone a gift. A gift given to a guest 
              or the host is not opened in the presence of the giver."
Singapore,The People,"Be careful of the gift being misinterpreted as a bribe, even a 
              small gift. Never give a government official a gift, which might 
              be considered a bribe."
Singapore,The People,Always bring the hosts a gift when invited to someone's home.
Singapore,The People,Helpful Hints
Singapore,The People,"Singapore has strict regulations which carry stiff fines, 
              possible jail sentences or even death. You should never do the

              social occasion. Shake hands again when leaving. Your handshake 
              should be firm."
Singapore,Meeting and Greeting,"Singaporeans may bow slightly as they shake your hand. Many 
              Westerners are generally taller than Singaporeans, so it would be

              people is polite."

              someone, and you should never show the bottom of your feet. 
              Tapping your foot or fidgeting your legs denotes feebleness and

              one knee over the other."

South Korea,The People,"Korea is one of the most homogeneous countries in the world, 
            racially and linguistically. It has its own culture, language, dress 
            and cuisine, separate and distinct from its neighboring countries. 
            Hard work, filial piety and modesty are characteristics esteemed by 
            Koreans. They are proud of their traditional culture and their 
            modern economic success. Education is highly valued as the path to 
            status, money and success."
South Korea,The People,Meeting and Greeting
South Korea,The People,"The bow is the traditional Korean greeting, although it is 
              often accompanied by a handshake among men. To show respect when 
              shaking hands, support your right forearm with your left hand."
South Korea,The People,"Korean women usually nod slightly and will not shake hands 
              with Western men. Western women may offer their hand to a Korean 
              man."
South Korea,The People,"Bow when departing. Younger people wave (move their arm from 
              side to side)."
South Korea,The People,Names and Titles
South Korea,The People,"It is considered very impolite to address a Korean with his or 
              her given name. Address Koreans using appropriate professional 
              titles until specifically invited by your host or colleagues to 
              use their given names."
South Korea,The People,"Americans should address a Korean with Mr., Mrs., Miss + 
              family name; however, never address a high-ranking person or 
              superior in this manner."
South Korea,The People,"Korean names are the opposite of Western names with the family 
              name first, followed by the two-part given name. The first of the 
              two given names is shared by everyone of the same generation in 
              the family, and the second is the individual's given name. 
              Example: Lee (Family) + Dong (Shared Given) + Sung (Given). Dong 
              Sung is the individual's given name. Address him as Mr. Lee or Lee 
              Sonsaengnim (which means ""teacher"")."
South Korea,The People,Body Language
South Korea,The People,"Koreans consider it a personal violation to be touched by 
              someone who is not a relative or close friend. Avoid touching, 
              patting or back slapping a Korean."
South Korea,The People,"Direct eye contact between junior and senior businesspeople 
              should be avoided. This is seen as impolite or even as a 
              challenge."
South Korea,The People,"Do not cross your legs or stretch your legs out straight in 
              front of you. Keep your feet on the floor, never on a desk or 
              chair."
South Korea,The People,"Always pass and receive objects with your right hand 
              (supported by the left hand at the wrist or forearm) or with two 
              hands."
South Korea,The People,"To beckon someone, extend your arm, palm down, and move your 
              fingers in a scratching motion. Never point with your index 
              finger."
South Korea,The People,Corporate Culture
South Korea,The People,"Koreans expect Westerners to be punctual for social occasions 
              and business meetings. Call if you will be delayed. However, you 
              may be kept waiting up to a half hour. This is not a sign of 
              disrespect, but reflects the pressure of time on Korean 
              executives."
South Korea,The People,"Professionals meeting for the first time usually exchange 
              business cards. Present your card and receive your colleague's 
              card with both hands."
South Korea,The People,"Building trust and relationships is vital to establishing a 
              successful business relationship. This requires patience. Koreans 
              prefer to do business with people they know."
South Korea,The People,"The first meeting is to establish trust, so business should 
              not be discussed. Be formal in meetings until the Korean 
              delegation loosens up."
South Korea,The People,"Negotiations are generally long and require several trips. Be 
              prepared for business meetings to go well beyond business hours."
South Korea,The People,"Koreans generally start negotiations at an unreasonable 
              position and prepare to compromise. Koreans are tough negotiators 
              and admire a firm, persistent negotiator, but refrain from being 
              too aggressive."
South Korea,The People,"A low, deep bow from Koreans at the end of a meeting indicates 
              a successful meeting. A quick, short parting bow could mean 
              dissatisfaction with meetings. Send a meeting review outlining all 
              discussions and agreements to your Korean counterpart after you 
              leave Korea. Make several visits during negotiations and after 
              business is established."
South Korea,The People,"""Yes"" is not necessarily “yes.” Koreans avoid saying ""no."" Try 
              to phrase questions in a manner that doesn't require a ""yes"" or 
              ""no"" answer. Example: Instead of saying ""Could we sign the 
              agreement by next Friday?” say ""When is the earliest date that we 
              could expect to sign this agreement?"""
South Korea,The People,Dining and Entertainment
South Korea,The People,"Sharing a dinner is vital to building friendships that foster 
              trust. Your business success is directly related to your social 
              relationships."
South Korea,The People,"Do not pour your own drink, but do offer to pour others'. It 
              is common to trade and fill each other's cup. To refuse is an 
              insult. Women pour men's drinks, but never another woman's drink. 
              A woman may pour her own drink. Leave some drink in your glass if 
              you don't want a refill."
South Korea,The People,"Wherever you see a ""No Tipping"" sign, do not tip. Koreans find 
              tipping offensive, although tipping is now becoming expected in 
              Western hotels."
South Korea,The People,"Always allow your host to seat you. The seat of honor is the 
              seat looking at the front door. If you are seated in the seat of 
              honor, it is polite to protest slightly."
South Korea,The People,"Koreans do not like to talk a lot during dinner. Periods of 
              silence are common and appreciated at a dinner. The meal usually 
              comes before socializing at a dinner party."
South Korea,The People,"It is polite to pass or accept food or drink with your right 
              hand while your left hand supports your forearm/wrist."
South Korea,The People,"The person who invites pays the bill for everyone. However, it 
              is polite to offer to pay. When two people are dining, usually the 
              younger person pays for the older person."
South Korea,The People,"Prepare to sing a solo number after dinner, no matter what 
              kind of voice you have. Any song is acceptable, as long as you 
              sing with spirit."
South Korea,The People,"After dinner, the host may invite his guests to go drinking. 
              Don't refuse this invitation."
South Korea,The People,Dress
South Korea,The People,"Koreans dress well, and you should dress accordingly to show 
              respect for them. A formal suit and tie is almost always 
              appropriate. Koreans dress up for city activities, especially in 
              Seoul."
South Korea,The People,"Women dress modestly. Prepare to sit on the floor; avoid 
              straight, tight skirts."
South Korea,The People,Gifts
South Korea,The People,"Gift giving is very common in Korea. Offer and receive a gift 
              with both hands. Wrapped gifts are never opened in the presence of 
              the giver."
South Korea,The People,"Reciprocate with a gift of similar value when receiving a gift 
              from your Korean colleague. Koreans like regional United States 
              gifts and Indian/Western artifacts."
South Korea,The People,"Wrap your gift nicely. Bright colors are preferred for 
              wrapping gifts. Yellow and red or green stripes are a traditional 
              Korean wrapping paper design. Avoid wrapping gifts in dark colors 
              or red."
South Korea,The People,"Always bring a small gift for the hostess when invited to 
              someone's home. Give: small gift, candy, cakes, cookies, flowers, 
              fruit. Do not give liquor to a woman."
South Korea,The People,"It is common to exchange gifts at the first business meeting. 
              Allow the host to present his gift first."
South Korea,The People,"Give: liquor (good quality scotch), fruit, desk accessories, 
              small mementos, gifts from France or Italy (which often indicate 
              status)."
South Korea,The People,"Do not give: expensive gifts (Koreans will feel obligated to 
              reciprocate with a gift of equal value), knives or scissors (they 
              signify ""cutting off"" a relationship), green headwear, gifts with 
              red writing (denotes death) or gifts in a set of four (denotes 
              death)."
South Korea,The People,Helpful Hints
South Korea,The People,"Never use words like ""fellow,"" ""guy,"" ""this man"" or ""that 
              man."" This is considered demeaning."
South Korea,The People,"Koreans are not Chinese. They are distinct from other Asians 
              in food, language and culture."
South Korea,The People,"Expect Koreans to ask personal questions. This is viewed as 
              showing a polite interest in your life."
South Korea,The People,"Deny a compliment. Don't say ""thank you."" It is impolite and 
              shows a lack of humility."
South Korea,The People,"Never expect Koreans to admit to not knowing an answer when 
              questioned. They may give an incorrect answer or an answer they 
              think you would like to hear to make you feel good or to save 
              face."
South Korea,The People,"Don't talk about Koreans or their customs or culture within 
              earshot of a Korean, even if you are saying good things. Do not 
              talk about politics."
South Korea,The People,Especially for Women
South Korea,The People,"Foreign women may have difficulty doing business in Korea. 
              Although women are becoming more accepted in the Korean 
              businessplace, Korean men generally prefer to negotiate with men."
South Korea,The People,"Korean women seldom shake hands. A Western woman can offer her 
              hand to a Korean man, but should not to a Korean woman."
South Korea,The People,"Foreign businesswomen should always act elegant, refined and 
              very ""feminine.” Laughing and loud talking are frowned upon."
South Korea,The People,"Generally, women wait for Korean men to make the first move."
South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"The bow is the traditional Korean greeting, although it is

              Western hotels."
South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"Always allow your host to seat you. The seat of honor is the

              honor, it is polite to protest slightly."
South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"Koreans do not like to talk a lot during dinner. Periods of

              questioned. They may give an incorrect answer or an answer they

              face."

              businessplace, Korean men generally prefer to negotiate with men."

              very ""feminine.” Laughing and loud talking are frowned upon."
South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"Generally, women wait for Korean men to make the first move."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"It is considered very impolite to address a Korean with his or 
              her given name. Address Koreans using appropriate professional 
              titles until specifically invited by your host or colleagues to 
              use their given names."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Americans should address a Korean with Mr., Mrs., Miss + 
              family name; however, never address a high-ranking person or 
              superior in this manner."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Korean names are the opposite of Western names with the family 
              name first, followed by the two-part given name. The first of the 
              two given names is shared by everyone of the same generation in 
              the family, and the second is the individual's given name. 
              Example: Lee (Family) + Dong (Shared Given) + Sung (Given). Dong 
              Sung is the individual's given name. Address him as Mr. Lee or Lee 
              Sonsaengnim (which means ""teacher"")."
South Korea,Names and Titles,Body Language
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Koreans consider it a personal violation to be touched by 
              someone who is not a relative or close friend. Avoid touching, 
              patting or back slapping a Korean."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Direct eye contact between junior and senior businesspeople 
              should be avoided. This is seen as impolite or even as a 
              challenge."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Do not cross your legs or stretch your legs out straight in 
              front of you. Keep your feet on the floor, never on a desk or 
              chair."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Always pass and receive objects with your right hand 
              (supported by the left hand at the wrist or forearm) or with two 
              hands."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"To beckon someone, extend your arm, palm down, and move your

              finger."
South Korea,Names and Titles,Corporate Culture
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Koreans expect Westerners to be punctual for social occasions 
              and business meetings. Call if you will be delayed. However, you 
              may be kept waiting up to a half hour. This is not a sign of 
              disrespect, but reflects the pressure of time on Korean 
              executives."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Professionals meeting for the first time usually exchange 
              business cards. Present your card and receive your colleague's

              successful business relationship. This requires patience. Koreans 
              prefer to do business with people they know."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"The first meeting is to establish trust, so business should 
              not be discussed. Be formal in meetings until the Korean 
              delegation loosens up."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Negotiations are generally long and require several trips. Be 
              prepared for business meetings to go well beyond business hours."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Koreans generally start negotiations at an unreasonable 
              position and prepare to compromise. Koreans are tough negotiators 
              and admire a firm, persistent negotiator, but refrain from being 
              too aggressive."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"A low, deep bow from Koreans at the end of a meeting indicates 
              a successful meeting. A quick, short parting bow could mean 
              dissatisfaction with meetings. Send a meeting review outlining all 
              discussions and agreements to your Korean counterpart after you 
              leave Korea. Make several visits during negotiations and after 
              business is established."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"""Yes"" is not necessarily “yes.” Koreans avoid saying ""no."" Try 
              to phrase questions in a manner that doesn't require a ""yes"" or 
              ""no"" answer. Example: Instead of saying ""Could we sign the 
              agreement by next Friday?” say ""When is the earliest date that we 
              could expect to sign this agreement?"""

South Korea,Names and Titles,"Do not pour your own drink, but do offer to pour others'. It

South Korea,Body Language,"Korean women seldom shake hands. A Western woman can offer her 
              hand to a Korean man, but should not to a Korean woman."
South Korea,Body Language,"Foreign businesswomen should always act elegant, refined and 
              very ""feminine.” Laughing and loud talking are frowned upon."
South Korea,Body Language,"Generally, women wait for Korean men to make the first move."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Koreans expect Westerners to be punctual for social occasions 
              and business meetings. Call if you will be delayed. However, you 
              may be kept waiting up to a half hour. This is not a sign of 
              disrespect, but reflects the pressure of time on Korean 
              executives."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Professionals meeting for the first time usually exchange 
              business cards. Present your card and receive your colleague's 
              card with both hands."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Building trust and relationships is vital to establishing a 
              successful business relationship. This requires patience. Koreans 
              prefer to do business with people they know."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"The first meeting is to establish trust, so business should 
              not be discussed. Be formal in meetings until the Korean 
              delegation loosens up."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Negotiations are generally long and require several trips. Be 
              prepared for business meetings to go well beyond business hours."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Koreans generally start negotiations at an unreasonable 
              position and prepare to compromise. Koreans are tough negotiators 
              and admire a firm, persistent negotiator, but refrain from being 
              too aggressive."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"A low, deep bow from Koreans at the end of a meeting indicates 
              a successful meeting. A quick, short parting bow could mean 
              dissatisfaction with meetings. Send a meeting review outlining all 
              discussions and agreements to your Korean counterpart after you 
              leave Korea. Make several visits during negotiations and after 
              business is established."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"""Yes"" is not necessarily “yes.” Koreans avoid saying ""no."" Try 
              to phrase questions in a manner that doesn't require a ""yes"" or 
              ""no"" answer. Example: Instead of saying ""Could we sign the 
              agreement by next Friday?” say ""When is the earliest date that we 
              could expect to sign this agreement?"""
South Korea,Corporate Culture,Dining and Entertainment
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Sharing a dinner is vital to building friendships that foster 
              trust. Your business success is directly related to your social 
              relationships."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Do not pour your own drink, but do offer to pour others'. It 
              is common to trade and fill each other's cup. To refuse is an 
              insult. Women pour men's drinks, but never another woman's drink. 
              A woman may pour her own drink. Leave some drink in your glass if 
              you don't want a refill."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Wherever you see a ""No Tipping"" sign, do not tip. Koreans find 
              tipping offensive, although tipping is now becoming expected in 
              Western hotels."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Always allow your host to seat you. The seat of honor is the 
              seat looking at the front door. If you are seated in the seat of 
              honor, it is polite to protest slightly."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Koreans do not like to talk a lot during dinner. Periods of 
              silence are common and appreciated at a dinner. The meal usually 
              comes before socializing at a dinner party."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"It is polite to pass or accept food or drink with your right 
              hand while your left hand supports your forearm/wrist."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"The person who invites pays the bill for everyone. However, it 
              is polite to offer to pay. When two people are dining, usually the 
              younger person pays for the older person."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Prepare to sing a solo number after dinner, no matter what 
              kind of voice you have. Any song is acceptable, as long as you 
              sing with spirit."

              the giver."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Reciprocate with a gift of similar value when receiving a gift 
              from your Korean colleague. Koreans like regional United States 
              gifts and Indian/Western artifacts."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Wrap your gift nicely. Bright colors are preferred for 
              wrapping gifts. Yellow and red or green stripes are a traditional 
              Korean wrapping paper design. Avoid wrapping gifts in dark colors 
              or red."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Always bring a small gift for the hostess when invited to 
              someone's home. Give: small gift, candy, cakes, cookies, flowers, 
              fruit. Do not give liquor to a woman."

            centered around the extended family, their most important economic 
            resource. They dislike loud, showy and unrefined behavior. Bringing 
            shame on anyone (""loss of face"") brings shame to the entire family."

              late is acceptable. Businesspeople might be late or even miss a 
              meeting."
Taiwan,The People,"Business cards should be printed in English on one side and 
              Chinese on the other. Make sure that the Chinese side uses 
              ""classical"" characters, the written form of Chinese used in

Taiwan,The People,"If possible, bring a team of two to four people (one senior 
              person with decision-making power) to Taiwan. This enhances the

Taiwan,The People,"Allow your counterparts in Taiwan to set the negotiation pace. 
              Don't set deadlines; if you do, don't disclose them. Decisions are 
              made collectively and thus are slow, particularly in the early 
              stages. Once facts are established, agreements can sometimes be 
              reached quickly."
Taiwan,The People,"People in Taiwan often state their ideas clearly and without 
              hesitation. However, they will generally not say a direct ""no.""

              your chances of success."
Taiwan,The People,"Dining in Taiwan can be elaborate and exhausting with as many 
              as twenty courses at a banquet. Business entertainment can last

Taiwan,The People,"If your Taiwan hosts drink a toast to you and pass you an 
              empty glass, it will be filled by one of the hosts. You are

              hours."
Taiwan,The People,"The guest of honor samples any dish brought to the table

Taiwan,The People,"The hosts will place food on the guests' plates. Each person

              food from a variety of dishes in his/her individual rice bowl."

              their fingers."
Taiwan,The People,"Never place bones or seeds in your rice bowl. If a plate is 
              not provided for this purpose, place them on the table."
Taiwan,The People,A belch may be considered a compliment at the end of a meal.
Taiwan,The People,"Tea is served at the end of the meal. This signals the end of

              to stay longer."

              late is acceptable. Businesspeople might be late or even miss a 
              meeting."
Taiwan,Body Language,"Business cards should be printed in English on one side and 
              Chinese on the other. Make sure that the Chinese side uses 
              ""classical"" characters, the written form of Chinese used in

              the meeting."
Taiwan,Body Language,"Businesspeople in Taiwan are hard bargainers and may try to

Taiwan,Body Language,"Allow your counterparts in Taiwan to set the negotiation pace. 
              Don't set deadlines; if you do, don't disclose them. Decisions are

              reached quickly."

              hesitation. However, they will generally not say a direct ""no.""

              will want to know you personally before they do business with you.

              commercial relationships."

              hours."

            same time happy with what they are and what they have materially. 
            They are smiling, pleasant, humble and patient people who laugh 
            easily, speak softly, are slow to anger, and never try to cause 
            anyone to lose face. Thais are very proud of their cultural heritage 
            and enjoy talking about it with visitors. Thais are proud that they 
            have never been ruled by a Western power."
Thailand,The People,Meeting and Greeting
Thailand,The People,"When being introduced or greeting someone, men say 
              Sawatdee-krap and women say Sawatdee-kah."
Thailand,The People,"Thais greet each other with a ""wai."" Foreigners are not 
              expected to initiate the wai gesture, but it is an insult not to 
              return the wai. If a wai is not offered to you, shake hands with 
              men and smile and nod to women. A Thai businessperson may shake 
              hands with a foreigner. Offer a wai only to a person of equal or 
              greater status. Subordinates should offer a wai first."
Thailand,The People,"Wai (why) - a person places the palm of his or her hands 
              together, with their fingers extended at chest level close to 
              their body and bows slightly. The higher the hands are placed, the 
              more respect is shown. Subordinates might raise their fingers as 
              high as their nose. However, the tips of their fingers should 
              never be above eye level."
Thailand,The People,"A wai can mean ""Hello,"" ""Thank you,"" ""I'm sorry,"" or 
              ""Goodbye."" A wai is not used to greet children, servants, street 
              vendors or laborers. Never return a wai to a child, waiter, clerk, 
              etc. Simply nod and smile in response."
Thailand,The People,Monks do not return a wai.
Thailand,The People,"Thais say ""Where are you going"" rather than ""Hello."" A polite 
              response is ""Just down the street."""
Thailand,The People,"Introductions are common only in a formal situation. Introduce 
              yourself by your first name. Feel free to introduce yourself or 
              ask for someone's name. When introducing your business partner to 
              an important Thai, mention your partner's name first."
Thailand,The People,"The inferior or lower-status person is always addressed first 
              in an introduction. Thus, a child is introduced before its 
              parents, a secretary is introduced before her boss."
Thailand,The People,Names and Titles
Thailand,The People,"Thais address one another by first names and titles and 
              reserve last names for very formal occasions and written 
              communications. Last names have been used in Thailand for only the 
              past fifty years and are difficult even for Thais to pronounce. 
              Two people with the same last name are almost certainly related."
Thailand,The People,"Foreigners are often addressed by their given names because it 
              is easier for Thais; it does not imply familiarity. Thais will 
              probably call you Mr. Joe or Mrs. Mary."
Thailand,The People,"Titles, rank and honor are very important. Introductions 
              require only the given name and title. Mr., Mrs., or Miss + family 
              name are appropriate for visitors to use in formal situations."
Thailand,The People,"Thai given names are preceded by Khun (Mr. Mrs. or Miss), 
              unless they carry a higher degree, such as doctor. Khun is used 
              for men and women, married or single. If you don't know a person's 
              name, address them as Khun. Example: Anuwat (Given) + 
              Wattapongsiri (Family) is Khun Anuwat."
Thailand,The People,"Correspondence: Use Dear + Khun + given name. Example: Dear 
              Khun Mary."

Thailand,The People,Corporate Culture
Thailand,The People,"Thailand has a pro-business attitude. Business decisions are 
              slow. Decisions pass through many levels before being decided 
              upon. Planning is short-term. Top management is often family. Who 
              you know is important. Powerful connections are respected."
Thailand,The People,"First meetings generally produce good humor, many smiles, 
              polite conversation and few results. The second meeting should 
              include a meal invitation. Meetings begin with small talk. 
              Discussing business before becoming acquainted is impolite. 
              Degrees, especially from prestigious universities, bring status. 
              Thais may list these on their business card. Thais respect 
              foreigners with powerful connections."
Thailand,The People,"Negotiations may be lengthy. Process takes precedence over 
              content. Slow information flow may delay discussions and 
              decisions."
Thailand,The People,"Thais prefer to work later in the evening rather than early in 
              the morning. Business is kept separate from work. Family comes 
              first before business."

              negative reply."
Thailand,The People,Body Language
Thailand,The People,"Touching between people of the same sex is more common in 
              Thailand than in many other Asian countries. However, touching 
              someone of the opposite sex is taboo. Do not show affection in 
              public."
Thailand,The People,"Never touch or pass anything over anyone's head. The head is 
              considered sacred in Thailand and must be respected."
Thailand,The People,"Never point your feet at anyone or use your feet to move 
              anything or touch anyone. Feet are regarded as unclean and

Thailand,The People,"Do not put your hands in your pockets while talking to 
              someone. Never put your arm over the back of the chair in which 
              someone is sitting."
Thailand,The People,"A smile is often used for many different emotions. It may be 
              an apology, a thank-you, a greeting, or to show embarrassment. Be 
              aware: A Thai's smiling assurance does not mean you will in fact 
              get what you want, when you want it. It simply reflects the Thai 
              appreciation of harmony and their ""never mind"" attitude."
Thailand,The People,"Don't wave your hands about as you talk, giving Thais the 
              impression that you are angry. Never pass anything with your left 
              hand. Never point with your hand and never, never with one finger."
Thailand,The People,"Do not cross your legs in the presence of the elderly or 
              monks."

              ""Nong"" (brother or sister). Never snap your fingers or raise your 
              voice to attract a waiter."
Thailand,The People,"Thai food is eaten with a fork and a tablespoon rather than 
              with chopsticks. The spoon is held in the right hand and the

              and coriander, but most are not especially aggressive. Food is

              has its own specialties."

              mixed with rice. Rice is eaten with almost every meal."

              finished eating, to show you are full. Place your spoon and fork 
              on your plate at the 5:25 position to indicate you are finished 
              eating."

              restaurant."

              and a headscarf."
Thailand,Meeting and Greeting,"Traditional Thais believe a woman can lose face if a man 
              touches her in public."
Thailand,Names and Titles,"Thais address one another by first names and titles and 
              reserve last names for very formal occasions and written 
              communications. Last names have been used in Thailand for only the 
              past fifty years and are difficult even for Thais to pronounce. 
              Two people with the same last name are almost certainly related."
Thailand,Names and Titles,"Foreigners are often addressed by their given names because it 
              is easier for Thais; it does not imply familiarity. Thais will 
              probably call you Mr. Joe or Mrs. Mary."
Thailand,Names and Titles,"Titles, rank and honor are very important. Introductions 
              require only the given name and title. Mr., Mrs., or Miss + family 
              name are appropriate for visitors to use in formal situations."
Thailand,Names and Titles,"Thai given names are preceded by Khun (Mr. Mrs. or Miss), 
              unless they carry a higher degree, such as doctor. Khun is used 
              for men and women, married or single. If you don't know a person's 
              name, address them as Khun. Example: Anuwat (Given) + 
              Wattapongsiri (Family) is Khun Anuwat."
Thailand,Names and Titles,"Correspondence: Use Dear + Khun + given name. Example: Dear 
              Khun Mary."

            immigrants from former British colonies and other parts of U.K. 
            Welsh take great pride in their country and their heritage. The

              with a casual ""Hello"" or ""How are you?"" or even just ""Hi."" In 
              larger groups, many may not greet you at all. In social 
              situations, Americans rarely shake hands upon leaving."
United States,The People,"The only proper answers to the greetings ""How do you do?"" ""How 
              are you?"" or ""How are you doing?"" are ""Fine,"" ""Great,"" or ""Very 
              well, thank you."" This is not a request for information about your 
              well-being; it is simply a pleasantry."
United States,The People,"""See you later"" is just an expression. People say this even if 
              they never plan to see you again."
United States,The People,"When saying good-bye, Americans may say ""We'll have to get 
              together"" or ""Let's do lunch."" This is simply a friendly gesture. 
              Unless your American colleague specifies a time and date, don't 
              expect an invitation. If you want to have lunch, you should take 
              the initiative to schedule it."

United States,The People,"It is good to include some information about a person you are

              Harmon. He designed the brochure we are using for this campaign."""
United States,The People,"Use professional titles when you are introducing people to 
              each other. Example: ""Judge Susan Olson, meet Dr. John Harmon."" If 
              you are introducing yourself, do not use your professional title."
United States,The People,"Handshakes are usually brief. Light handshakes are considered 
              distasteful. Use a firm grip."
United States,The People,Eye contact is important when shaking someone’s hand.
United States,The People,Body Language
United States,The People,"Keep your distance when conversing. If an American feels you 
              are standing too close, he or she may step back without even 
              thinking about it."
United States,The People,"People who like to touch really like touching, and people who 
              do not like to touch really dislike being touched. You will need 
              to watch your colleagues for clues on what they are comfortable

              others a light slap on the back to show friendship."
United States,The People,Corporate Culture
United States,The People,"In a country that prides itself on its individualism, companies 
            are organized and structured with many different styles depending on 
            the industry, the company's history and its current leaders. In the 
            United States, business relationships are formed between companies 
            rather than between people. Americans do business where they get the 
            best deal and the best service. It is not important to develop a 
            personal relationship in order to establish a long and successful 
            business relationship."
United States,The People,"Americans view the business card as a source of future 
              information and tend to exchange cards casually. There is no set 
              ritual for exchanging business cards."
United States,The People,"Americans prefer directness in communication. When Americans 
              say ""yes"" or ""no,"" they mean precisely that. ""Maybe"" really does 
              mean ""it might happen""; it does not mean ""no."""
United States,The People,"It is always proper to ask questions if you do not understand 
              something. Americans ask questions -- lots of them. They are not 
              ashamed to admit what they do know. Americans will assume you 
              understand something if you do not tell them otherwise."
United States,The People,"Americans are often uncomfortable with silence. Silence is 
              avoided in social or business meetings."
United States,The People,"It is rude to interrupt someone who is talking. Say, ""Excuse 
              me"" during a pause and wait to be recognized. Interruptions, 
              however, are common. Do not be surprised if someone finishes your 
              sentence if you hesitate when you are speaking."
United States,The People,"Americans put a great deal of value on the written word. 
              American law almost always requires contracts to be written out. 
              Verbal contracts are rarely legally binding. Make sure you read 
              the fine print."
United States,The People,"Do not enter into any contract without hiring a lawyer. No 
              savvy American businessperson would dream of signing a contract 
              before consulting a lawyer."
United States,The People,"It is very important in written communication to spell names 
              correctly and have correct titles. If you are unsure of these, 
              call the person's assistant to get the correct spelling and title."
United States,The People,"Keep appointments once they are made. You may not get a second 
              chance if you do not."
United States,The People,"When you are doing business in the United States, you must be 
              on time. Americans view someone being late as rude, showing a lack 
              of respect and having sloppy, undisciplined personal habits."
United States,The People,"Being ""on time"" in business situations generally means being 
              about five minutes early. Five minutes late is acceptable with a 
              brief apology. Ten to fifteen minutes late requires a phone call 
              to warn of the delay and to apologize."
United States,The People,"It is very important to meet deadlines. If you tell someone 
              that you will have a report to them by a certain date, or that you 
              will fax something to them immediately, they will take you at your 
              word. People who miss deadlines are viewed as irresponsible and 
              undependable."
United States,The People,"Meetings are generally informal and relaxed in manner, but 
              serious in content. Often an agenda will be distributed before a 
              meeting, so the participants will be prepared to discuss certain 
              topics. A successful meeting is short and to the point. Be 
              prepared to begin business immediately, with little or no prior 
              small talk."
United States,The People,"Participation is expected in meetings. A quiet person may be 
              viewed as not prepared or as having nothing important to 
              contribute."
United States,The People,"Meetings often end with a summary and an action plan for the 
              participants to execute. A meeting is only considered successful 
              if something concrete is decided."
United States,The People,"Americans appreciate and are impressed by numbers. Using 
              statistics to support your opinions will help you be persuasive."
United States,The People,"Generally, there is one negotiation leader who has the 
              authority to make decisions. Team negotiations are rare. Americans 
              may begin negotiations with unacceptable conditions or demands. 
              They are usually taking a starting position that gives them room 
              to bargain."
United States,The People,"The goal of most negotiations in the United States is to 
              arrive at a signed contract. Long-term relationships and benefits 
              may not be the main objective. The immediate deal may be the only 
              important issue."
United States,The People,"Negotiations may seem rushed to you. Remember that ""time is 
              money"" to Americans and that they may not think that building a 
              relationship with potential business partners is necessary."
United States,The People,"Americans are very comfortable picking up the telephone and 
              immediately conducting business with someone they have never met 
              and perhaps never will meet."
United States,The People,Dining and Entertainment
United States,The People,"Americans conduct business over breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
              Some socializing may start off the meal, but often the 
              conversation will revolve around business."
United States,The People,"In a business setting the person extending the invitation to a 
              meal pays for it."
United States,The People,"The fork is held in the left hand, tines facing down. The 
              knife is held in the right hand. After cutting the food, the knife 
              is laid down and the fork is switched to the right hand to eat the 
              cut food. Continental style (where the fork stays in the left hand 
              to eat the cut food) is perfectly acceptable."
United States,The People,"The guest of honor is often toasted and should reciprocate by 
              giving a toast of thanks."
United States,The People,"Your napkin should be placed on your lap shortly after you are 
              seated and kept on your lap at all times during the meal. Do not 
              tuck your napkin under your chin."
United States,The People,"Raise your hand or index finger and make eye contact to signal 
              a server."
United States,The People,Dinner at an American home may be fairly informal.
United States,The People,"Do not be late for a dinner party. Arrive within 5 to 15 
              minutes after the time on the invitation. Never arrive before the 
              time you were invited. If you are going to be more than 15 minutes 
              late, phone your hosts and apologize."
United States,The People,"Never begin eating until everyone is served and your hosts 
              have begun. Offer food or drink to others before helping yourself. 
              Serve all women at the table first."
United States,The People,"If offered a second helping of food, feel free to take what 
              you like. Americans like people to eat a lot."
United States,The People,"When you are invited to an event, it is very important to call 
              or drop a note letting the host know if you will attend. That 
              said, Americans are notorious for not responding to invitations."
United States,The People,"Do not be afraid of hurting someone's feelings by responding 
              ""no"" to an invitation. People will be offended if you say you will 
              attend and then do not come."
United States,The People,"If an invitation reads ""6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.,"" leave very 
              close to the ending time stated."
United States,The People,"Americans tend to eat more quickly than people from other 
              countries. Dining in the United States is seldom the long, 
              lingering event it is in much of the world. The point is more 
              often to eat rather than socialize and savor the meal."
United States,The People,Dress
United States,The People,"The appropriate clothing for business varies widely. Proper dress 
            depends on the region of the country, a person's company, his or her 
            position within it and the industry in which he or she works. The 
            best approach is to be conservative until you have had a chance to 
            observe what others wear in an office. You can always get more 
            casual after you get a sense of how people dress. You cannot lose, 
            however, if you begin with a very professional attire and manner."
United States,The People,"Men: socks should match your suit. No leg should show between 
              pant hem and shoe. Remove your hat when indoors."
United States,The People,"Women: do not overdress for daytime or wear flashy or noisy 
              jewelry. American women do not wear a lot of makeup to the office. 
              Low-cut blouses, short skirts and tight clothing are not 
              appropriate office attire."
United States,The People,Gifts
United States,The People,"Americans do not have as many customs and taboos concerning 
              gifts as many other cultures have."
United States,The People,"Gifts from your country will always be appreciated. Good 
              choices are local and regional arts and crafts, books, candies, 
              specialty foods and wine or spirits (if you are certain that the 
              recipient drinks)."
United States,The People,"If you are invited to someone's home for dinner or a party, 
              bring flowers, a potted plant, a fruit basket, candy, wine, a book 
              or a small household gift."
United States,The People,"Many companies have policies that discourage their employees 
              from giving or receiving gifts. Most government employees are not 
              allowed to accept gifts. Do not be offended if someone cannot 
              accept a gift."
United States,The People,Cash gifts are never appropriate.
United States,The People,Helpful Hints
United States,The People,"It is considered rude to stare, ask questions or otherwise 
              bring attention to someone's disability."
United States,The People,"Smoking is very unpopular in the United States. Restaurants 
              have separate smoking and nonsmoking sections. Public and private 
              buildings may ban smoking except in designated areas. Some people 
              do not allow smoking in their homes and will ask you to go outside 
              if you want to have a cigarette. Never smoke anywhere without 
              asking permission from everyone present."
United States,The People,"Names are not held as sacred in the United States. Someone may 
              mispronounce your name and laugh a bit as they do it. Or someone 
              may just call you by your given name if your family name is too 
              difficult to pronounce."
United States,The People,"There are several common names and nicknames that are used by 
              both men and women. Call the person's assistant to ask if you are 
              unsure of his or her gender."
United States,The People,"""Please"" and ""thank you"" are very important in the United 
              States. Say ""please"" and ""thank you"" to everyone for even the 
              smallest kindness. Americans say them regardless of rank or how 
              much they are paying for something, and they expect others to do 
              the same."
United States,The People,"Say ""Pardon me"" or ""Excuse me"" if you touch someone or even 
              get close to someone. Americans also say this if they sneeze or 
              cough or do not understand something someone has said."
United States,The People,"Americans often share things in casual conversation, even with 
              strangers, that may seem shockingly private."
United States,The People,"Social conversation in the United States is light. There is a 
              standard format for small talk. People ask brief questions and 
              expect brief answers. Americans become uncomfortable when one 
              person talks for any length of time in a social situation."
United States,The People,"If you feel uncomfortable with a question asked of you, simply 
              smile and say, ""In my country, that would be a strange question."""
United States,The People,American Women
United States,The People,"Women are leaders in all aspects of American life from 
              business to education to government. Never assume that a working 
              woman is in a subordinate position."
United States,The People,"American women are independent. They will not appreciate any 
              ""special help"" offered because of their gender. Do not assume that 
              a woman needs more time or more help than a man doing the same 
              job."
United States,The People,"American women pride themselves on the number of 
              responsibilities they take on. Do not assume that a working woman 
              is no longer the primary caretaker of her family and children."
United States,The People,"When addressing a woman, use the title ""Ms."" unless you know 
              that she prefers ""Mrs."" or ""Miss."""
United States,The People,"Many women keep their maiden names after marriage. Some use 
              both their maiden and married names."
United States,The People,"When going to dinner or lunch, the person who invites pays, 
              whether it is a man or a woman."
United States,The People,"Do not touch a woman in a business setting except to shake her 
              hand. Hugging and kissing, even of people you know very well, is 
              best left for social occasions."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"American greetings are generally quite informal. This is not 
              intended to show lack of respect, but rather a manifestation of 
              the American belief that everyone is equal."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Although it is expected in business situations, some Americans 
              do not shake hands at social events. Instead, they may greet you

              will fax something to them immediately, they will take you at your 
              word. People who miss deadlines are viewed as irresponsible and 
              undependable."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Meetings are generally informal and relaxed in manner, but 
              serious in content. Often an agenda will be distributed before a 
              meeting, so the participants will be prepared to discuss certain 
              topics. A successful meeting is short and to the point. Be 
              prepared to begin business immediately, with little or no prior 
              small talk."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Participation is expected in meetings. A quiet person may be 
              viewed as not prepared or as having nothing important to 
              contribute."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Meetings often end with a summary and an action plan for the 
              participants to execute. A meeting is only considered successful 
              if something concrete is decided."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Americans appreciate and are impressed by numbers. Using 
              statistics to support your opinions will help you be persuasive."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Generally, there is one negotiation leader who has the 
              authority to make decisions. Team negotiations are rare. Americans 
              may begin negotiations with unacceptable conditions or demands. 
              They are usually taking a starting position that gives them room 
              to bargain."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"The goal of most negotiations in the United States is to 
              arrive at a signed contract. Long-term relationships and benefits 
              may not be the main objective. The immediate deal may be the only 
              important issue."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Negotiations may seem rushed to you. Remember that ""time is 
              money"" to Americans and that they may not think that building a 
              relationship with potential business partners is necessary."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Americans are very comfortable picking up the telephone and 
              immediately conducting business with someone they have never met 
              and perhaps never will meet."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,Dining and Entertainment
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Americans conduct business over breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
              Some socializing may start off the meal, but often the 
              conversation will revolve around business."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"In a business setting the person extending the invitation to a 
              meal pays for it."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"The fork is held in the left hand, tines facing down. The 
              knife is held in the right hand. After cutting the food, the knife 
              is laid down and the fork is switched to the right hand to eat the 
              cut food. Continental style (where the fork stays in the left hand 
              to eat the cut food) is perfectly acceptable."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"The guest of honor is often toasted and should reciprocate by 
              giving a toast of thanks."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Your napkin should be placed on your lap shortly after you are 
              seated and kept on your lap at all times during the meal. Do not 
              tuck your napkin under your chin."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Raise your hand or index finger and make eye contact to signal 
              a server."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,Dinner at an American home may be fairly informal.
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Do not be late for a dinner party. Arrive within 5 to 15 
              minutes after the time on the invitation. Never arrive before the 
              time you were invited. If you are going to be more than 15 minutes 
              late, phone your hosts and apologize."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Never begin eating until everyone is served and your hosts 
              have begun. Offer food or drink to others before helping yourself. 
              Serve all women at the table first."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"If offered a second helping of food, feel free to take what 
              you like. Americans like people to eat a lot."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"When you are invited to an event, it is very important to call 
              or drop a note letting the host know if you will attend. That 
              said, Americans are notorious for not responding to invitations."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Do not be afraid of hurting someone's feelings by responding 
              ""no"" to an invitation. People will be offended if you say you will 
              attend and then do not come."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"If an invitation reads ""6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.,"" leave very 
              close to the ending time stated."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Americans tend to eat more quickly than people from other 
              countries. Dining in the United States is seldom the long, 
              lingering event it is in much of the world. The point is more 
              often to eat rather than socialize and savor the meal."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,Dress
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"The appropriate clothing for business varies widely. Proper dress 
            depends on the region of the country, a person's company, his or her 
            position within it and the industry in which he or she works. The 
            best approach is to be conservative until you have had a chance to 
            observe what others wear in an office. You can always get more 
            casual after you get a sense of how people dress. You cannot lose, 
            however, if you begin with a very professional attire and manner."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Men: socks should match your suit. No leg should show between 
              pant hem and shoe. Remove your hat when indoors."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Women: do not overdress for daytime or wear flashy or noisy 
              jewelry. American women do not wear a lot of makeup to the office. 
              Low-cut blouses, short skirts and tight clothing are not 
              appropriate office attire."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,Gifts
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Americans do not have as many customs and taboos concerning 
              gifts as many other cultures have."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Gifts from your country will always be appreciated. Good 
              choices are local and regional arts and crafts, books, candies, 
              specialty foods and wine or spirits (if you are certain that the 
              recipient drinks)."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"If you are invited to someone's home for dinner or a party, 
              bring flowers, a potted plant, a fruit basket, candy, wine, a book 
              or a small household gift."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Many companies have policies that discourage their employees 
              from giving or receiving gifts. Most government employees are not 
              allowed to accept gifts. Do not be offended if someone cannot 
              accept a gift."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,Cash gifts are never appropriate.
United States,Meeting and Greeting,Helpful Hints
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"It is considered rude to stare, ask questions or otherwise 
              bring attention to someone's disability."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Smoking is very unpopular in the United States. Restaurants 
              have separate smoking and nonsmoking sections. Public and private 
              buildings may ban smoking except in designated areas. Some people 
              do not allow smoking in their homes and will ask you to go outside 
              if you want to have a cigarette. Never smoke anywhere without 
              asking permission from everyone present."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Names are not held as sacred in the United States. Someone may 
              mispronounce your name and laugh a bit as they do it. Or someone 
              may just call you by your given name if your family name is too 
              difficult to pronounce."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"There are several common names and nicknames that are used by 
              both men and women. Call the person's assistant to ask if you are 
              unsure of his or her gender."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"""Please"" and ""thank you"" are very important in the United 
              States. Say ""please"" and ""thank you"" to everyone for even the 
              smallest kindness. Americans say them regardless of rank or how 
              much they are paying for something, and they expect others to do 
              the same."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Say ""Pardon me"" or ""Excuse me"" if you touch someone or even 
              get close to someone. Americans also say this if they sneeze or 
              cough or do not understand something someone has said."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Americans often share things in casual conversation, even with 
              strangers, that may seem shockingly private."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Social conversation in the United States is light. There is a 
              standard format for small talk. People ask brief questions and 
              expect brief answers. Americans become uncomfortable when one 
              person talks for any length of time in a social situation."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"If you feel uncomfortable with a question asked of you, simply 
              smile and say, ""In my country, that would be a strange question."""
United States,Meeting and Greeting,American Women
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Women are leaders in all aspects of American life from 
              business to education to government. Never assume that a working 
              woman is in a subordinate position."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"American women are independent. They will not appreciate any 
              ""special help"" offered because of their gender. Do not assume that 
              a woman needs more time or more help than a man doing the same 
              job."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"American women pride themselves on the number of 
              responsibilities they take on. Do not assume that a working woman 
              is no longer the primary caretaker of her family and children."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"When addressing a woman, use the title ""Ms."" unless you know 
              that she prefers ""Mrs."" or ""Miss."""
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Many women keep their maiden names after marriage. Some use 
              both their maiden and married names."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"When going to dinner or lunch, the person who invites pays, 
              whether it is a man or a woman."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Do not touch a woman in a business setting except to shake her 
              hand. Hugging and kissing, even of people you know very well, is 
              best left for social occasions."
United States,Body Language,"Keep your distance when conversing. If an American feels you 
              are standing too close, he or she may step back without even 
              thinking about it."
United States,Body Language,"People who like to touch really like touching, and people who 
              do not like to touch really dislike being touched. You will need 
              to watch your colleagues for clues on what they are comfortable 
              with."
United States,Body Language,"Americans are generally uncomfortable with same-sex touching, 
              especially between males."
United States,Body Language,"Holding the middle finger up by itself is considered insulting 
              and vulgar."
United States,Body Language,"Americans smile a great deal, even at strangers. They like to 
              have their smiles returned."
United States,Body Language,"Men and women will sit with legs crossed at the ankles or 
              knees, or one ankle crossed on the knee."
United States,Body Language,"Some Americans are known as ""back slappers"" -- they give 
              others a light slap on the back to show friendship."
United States,Body Language,Corporate Culture
United States,Body Language,"In a country that prides itself on its individualism, companies 
            are organized and structured with many different styles depending on 
            the industry, the company's history and its current leaders. In the 
            United States, business relationships are formed between companies 
            rather than between people. Americans do business where they get the 
            best deal and the best service. It is not important to develop a 
            personal relationship in order to establish a long and successful 
            business relationship."
United States,Body Language,"Americans view the business card as a source of future 
              information and tend to exchange cards casually. There is no set 
              ritual for exchanging business cards."
United States,Body Language,"Americans prefer directness in communication. When Americans 
              say ""yes"" or ""no,"" they mean precisely that. ""Maybe"" really does 
              mean ""it might happen""; it does not mean ""no."""
United States,Body Language,"It is always proper to ask questions if you do not understand 
              something. Americans ask questions -- lots of them. They are not 
              ashamed to admit what they do know. Americans will assume you 
              understand something if you do not tell them otherwise."
United States,Body Language,"Americans are often uncomfortable with silence. Silence is 
              avoided in social or business meetings."
United States,Body Language,"It is rude to interrupt someone who is talking. Say, ""Excuse 
              me"" during a pause and wait to be recognized. Interruptions, 
              however, are common. Do not be surprised if someone finishes your 
              sentence if you hesitate when you are speaking."
United States,Body Language,"Americans put a great deal of value on the written word. 
              American law almost always requires contracts to be written out. 
              Verbal contracts are rarely legally binding. Make sure you read 
              the fine print."
United States,Body Language,"Do not enter into any contract without hiring a lawyer. No 
              savvy American businessperson would dream of signing a contract 
              before consulting a lawyer."
United States,Body Language,"It is very important in written communication to spell names 
              correctly and have correct titles. If you are unsure of these, 
              call the person's assistant to get the correct spelling and title."
United States,Body Language,"Keep appointments once they are made. You may not get a second 
              chance if you do not."
United States,Body Language,"When you are doing business in the United States, you must be 
              on time. Americans view someone being late as rude, showing a lack 
              of respect and having sloppy, undisciplined personal habits."
United States,Body Language,"Being ""on time"" in business situations generally means being 
              about five minutes early. Five minutes late is acceptable with a 
              brief apology. Ten to fifteen minutes late requires a phone call 
              to warn of the delay and to apologize."
United States,Body Language,"It is very important to meet deadlines. If you tell someone 
              that you will have a report to them by a certain date, or that you 
              will fax something to them immediately, they will take you at your

              get close to someone. Americans also say this if they sneeze or 
              cough or do not understand something someone has said."
United States,Body Language,"Americans often share things in casual conversation, even with 
              strangers, that may seem shockingly private."
United States,Body Language,"Social conversation in the United States is light. There is a 
              standard format for small talk. People ask brief questions and 
              expect brief answers. Americans become uncomfortable when one 
              person talks for any length of time in a social situation."
United States,Body Language,"If you feel uncomfortable with a question asked of you, simply 
              smile and say, ""In my country, that would be a strange question."""
United States,Body Language,American Women
United States,Body Language,"Women are leaders in all aspects of American life from 
              business to education to government. Never assume that a working 
              woman is in a subordinate position."
United States,Body Language,"American women are independent. They will not appreciate any 
              ""special help"" offered because of their gender. Do not assume that 
              a woman needs more time or more help than a man doing the same 
              job."
United States,Body Language,"American women pride themselves on the number of 
              responsibilities they take on. Do not assume that a working woman 
              is no longer the primary caretaker of her family and children."
United States,Body Language,"When addressing a woman, use the title ""Ms."" unless you know 
              that she prefers ""Mrs."" or ""Miss."""
United States,Body Language,"Many women keep their maiden names after marriage. Some use 
              both their maiden and married names."
United States,Body Language,"When going to dinner or lunch, the person who invites pays, 
              whether it is a man or a woman."
United States,Body Language,"Do not touch a woman in a business setting except to shake her 
              hand. Hugging and kissing, even of people you know very well, is 
              best left for social occasions."
United States,Corporate Culture,"In a country that prides itself on its individualism, companies 
            are organized and structured with many different styles depending on 
            the industry, the company's history and its current leaders. In the 
            United States, business relationships are formed between companies 
            rather than between people. Americans do business where they get the 
            best deal and the best service. It is not important to develop a 
            personal relationship in order to establish a long and successful 
            business relationship."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans view the business card as a source of future 
              information and tend to exchange cards casually. There is no set 
              ritual for exchanging business cards."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans prefer directness in communication. When Americans 
              say ""yes"" or ""no,"" they mean precisely that. ""Maybe"" really does 
              mean ""it might happen""; it does not mean ""no."""
United States,Corporate Culture,"It is always proper to ask questions if you do not understand 
              something. Americans ask questions -- lots of them. They are not 
              ashamed to admit what they do know. Americans will assume you 
              understand something if you do not tell them otherwise."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans are often uncomfortable with silence. Silence is 
              avoided in social or business meetings."
United States,Corporate Culture,"It is rude to interrupt someone who is talking. Say, ""Excuse 
              me"" during a pause and wait to be recognized. Interruptions, 
              however, are common. Do not be surprised if someone finishes your 
              sentence if you hesitate when you are speaking."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans put a great deal of value on the written word. 
              American law almost always requires contracts to be written out. 
              Verbal contracts are rarely legally binding. Make sure you read 
              the fine print."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Do not enter into any contract without hiring a lawyer. No 
              savvy American businessperson would dream of signing a contract 
              before consulting a lawyer."
United States,Corporate Culture,"It is very important in written communication to spell names 
              correctly and have correct titles. If you are unsure of these, 
              call the person's assistant to get the correct spelling and title."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Keep appointments once they are made. You may not get a second 
              chance if you do not."
United States,Corporate Culture,"When you are doing business in the United States, you must be 
              on time. Americans view someone being late as rude, showing a lack 
              of respect and having sloppy, undisciplined personal habits."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Being ""on time"" in business situations generally means being 
              about five minutes early. Five minutes late is acceptable with a 
              brief apology. Ten to fifteen minutes late requires a phone call 
              to warn of the delay and to apologize."
United States,Corporate Culture,"It is very important to meet deadlines. If you tell someone 
              that you will have a report to them by a certain date, or that you 
              will fax something to them immediately, they will take you at your 
              word. People who miss deadlines are viewed as irresponsible and 
              undependable."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Meetings are generally informal and relaxed in manner, but 
              serious in content. Often an agenda will be distributed before a 
              meeting, so the participants will be prepared to discuss certain 
              topics. A successful meeting is short and to the point. Be 
              prepared to begin business immediately, with little or no prior 
              small talk."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Participation is expected in meetings. A quiet person may be 
              viewed as not prepared or as having nothing important to 
              contribute."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Meetings often end with a summary and an action plan for the 
              participants to execute. A meeting is only considered successful 
              if something concrete is decided."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans appreciate and are impressed by numbers. Using 
              statistics to support your opinions will help you be persuasive."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Generally, there is one negotiation leader who has the 
              authority to make decisions. Team negotiations are rare. Americans 
              may begin negotiations with unacceptable conditions or demands. 
              They are usually taking a starting position that gives them room 
              to bargain."
United States,Corporate Culture,"The goal of most negotiations in the United States is to 
              arrive at a signed contract. Long-term relationships and benefits 
              may not be the main objective. The immediate deal may be the only 
              important issue."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Negotiations may seem rushed to you. Remember that ""time is 
              money"" to Americans and that they may not think that building a 
              relationship with potential business partners is necessary."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans are very comfortable picking up the telephone and 
              immediately conducting business with someone they have never met 
              and perhaps never will meet."
United States,Corporate Culture,Dining and Entertainment
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans conduct business over breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
              Some socializing may start off the meal, but often the 
              conversation will revolve around business."
United States,Corporate Culture,"In a business setting the person extending the invitation to a 
              meal pays for it."
United States,Corporate Culture,"The fork is held in the left hand, tines facing down. The 
              knife is held in the right hand. After cutting the food, the knife 
              is laid down and the fork is switched to the right hand to eat the 
              cut food. Continental style (where the fork stays in the left hand 
              to eat the cut food) is perfectly acceptable."
United States,Corporate Culture,"The guest of honor is often toasted and should reciprocate by 
              giving a toast of thanks."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Your napkin should be placed on your lap shortly after you are 
              seated and kept on your lap at all times during the meal. Do not 
              tuck your napkin under your chin."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Raise your hand or index finger and make eye contact to signal 
              a server."
United States,Corporate Culture,Dinner at an American home may be fairly informal.
United States,Corporate Culture,"Do not be late for a dinner party. Arrive within 5 to 15 
              minutes after the time on the invitation. Never arrive before the 
              time you were invited. If you are going to be more than 15 minutes 
              late, phone your hosts and apologize."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Never begin eating until everyone is served and your hosts 
              have begun. Offer food or drink to others before helping yourself. 
              Serve all women at the table first."
United States,Corporate Culture,"If offered a second helping of food, feel free to take what 
              you like. Americans like people to eat a lot."
United States,Corporate Culture,"When you are invited to an event, it is very important to call 
              or drop a note letting the host know if you will attend. That 
              said, Americans are notorious for not responding to invitations."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Do not be afraid of hurting someone's feelings by responding 
              ""no"" to an invitation. People will be offended if you say you will 
              attend and then do not come."
United States,Corporate Culture,"If an invitation reads ""6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.,"" leave very 
              close to the ending time stated."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans tend to eat more quickly than people from other 
              countries. Dining in the United States is seldom the long, 
              lingering event it is in much of the world. The point is more 
              often to eat rather than socialize and savor the meal."
United States,Corporate Culture,Dress
United States,Corporate Culture,"The appropriate clothing for business varies widely. Proper dress 
            depends on the region of the country, a person's company, his or her 
            position within it and the industry in which he or she works. The 
            best approach is to be conservative until you have had a chance to 
            observe what others wear in an office. You can always get more 
            casual after you get a sense of how people dress. You cannot lose, 
            however, if you begin with a very professional attire and manner."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Men: socks should match your suit. No leg should show between 
              pant hem and shoe. Remove your hat when indoors."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Women: do not overdress for daytime or wear flashy or noisy 
              jewelry. American women do not wear a lot of makeup to the office. 
              Low-cut blouses, short skirts and tight clothing are not 
              appropriate office attire."
United States,Corporate Culture,Gifts
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans do not have as many customs and taboos concerning 
              gifts as many other cultures have."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Gifts from your country will always be appreciated. Good 
              choices are local and regional arts and crafts, books, candies, 
              specialty foods and wine or spirits (if you are certain that the 
              recipient drinks)."
United States,Corporate Culture,"If you are invited to someone's home for dinner or a party, 
              bring flowers, a potted plant, a fruit basket, candy, wine, a book 
              or a small household gift."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Many companies have policies that discourage their employees 
              from giving or receiving gifts. Most government employees are not 
              allowed to accept gifts. Do not be offended if someone cannot 
              accept a gift."
United States,Corporate Culture,Cash gifts are never appropriate.
United States,Corporate Culture,Helpful Hints
United States,Corporate Culture,"It is considered rude to stare, ask questions or otherwise 
              bring attention to someone's disability."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Smoking is very unpopular in the United States. Restaurants 
              have separate smoking and nonsmoking sections. Public and private 
              buildings may ban smoking except in designated areas. Some people 
              do not allow smoking in their homes and will ask you to go outside 
              if you want to have a cigarette. Never smoke anywhere without 
              asking permission from everyone present."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Names are not held as sacred in the United States. Someone may 
              mispronounce your name and laugh a bit as they do it. Or someone 
              may just call you by your given name if your family name is too 
              difficult to pronounce."
United States,Corporate Culture,"There are several common names and nicknames that are used by 
              both men and women. Call the person's assistant to ask if you are 
              unsure of his or her gender."
United States,Corporate Culture,"""Please"" and ""thank you"" are very important in the United 
              States. Say ""please"" and ""thank you"" to everyone for even the 
              smallest kindness. Americans say them regardless of rank or how 
              much they are paying for something, and they expect others to do 
              the same."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Say ""Pardon me"" or ""Excuse me"" if you touch someone or even

United States,Dress,"The appropriate clothing for business varies widely. Proper dress

            position within it and the industry in which he or she works. The 
            best approach is to be conservative until you have had a chance to 
            observe what others wear in an office. You can always get more 
            casual after you get a sense of how people dress. You cannot lose,

Vietnam,The People,"A long struggle for independence has given the Vietnamese a deep 
            sense of national pride. Vietnamese value their independence and 
            history and offended by people who ignore or violate either. Most 
            Vietnamese have an interest in all things American. They believe all 
            past hostilities were part of the natural defense of their national 
            territory. Families are very strong and help each other in all 
            needs."
Vietnam,The People,Meeting and Greeting
Vietnam,The People,"The Vietnamese generally shake hands both when greeting and 
              when saying good-bye. Shake with both hands, and bow your head 
              slightly to show respect. Bow to the elderly who do not extend 
              their hand. Vietnamese women are more inclined to bow their head 
              slightly than to shake hands."
Vietnam,The People,"When greeting someone, say “xin chao” (seen chow) + given name 
              + title. The Vietnamese are delighted if a Westerner can properly 
              say “xin chao” (because Vietnamese is a tonal language, “xin chao” 
              can have six different meanings, only one of which is ""Hello"")."
Vietnam,The People,Body Language
Vietnam,The People,"Summoning someone with a curled index finger, as is done in 
              the West, is only done by the boss. To beckon someone, extend your 
              arm, palm down, and move your fingers in a scratching motion. Only 
              beckon someone who has a ""lower"" status than you."
Vietnam,The People,"Men and women do not show affection in public. However, 
              members of the same sex may hold hands while walking."
Vietnam,The People,"Always use both hands when passing an object to another 
              person."
Vietnam,The People,"Touching children on the head is only done by parents, 
              grandparents, etc."
Vietnam,The People,Corporate Culture
Vietnam,The People,"Business cards are usually exchanged when meeting for the 
              first time. Give and receive a business card with both hands."
Vietnam,The People,"The Vietnamese are generally quite punctual and expect 
              foreigners to be the same. That said, the Vietnamese can be very 
              flexible and accommodating when situations occur that are beyond 
              the control of one of the parties involved (for example, a 
              washed-out street, traffic jam, etc.)."
Vietnam,The People,"Few Vietnamese speak English well. An interpreter is usually 
              necessary."
Vietnam,The People,"A foreigner doing business in Vietnam will have to deal with 
              government officials. You may have to go through the same slow 
              procedure dozens of times to obtain the necessary permits to 
              operate a foreign-owned company in Vietnam. Continual, direct 
              contact with the ministry officials responsible for granting or 
              approving your permits and licenses is very important. 
              Difficulties may arise when one official refuses to honor an 
              agreement concluded by another official."
Vietnam,The People,"Most decisions are made by committee in Vietnam. Individual 
              connections are not as important as in many other Asian countries, 
              because no one holds absolute power to make a decision. You can 
              not rely on one person in a particular organization to safeguard 
              your interests."
Vietnam,The People,"The Vietnamese willingness to avoid unpleasantness can 
              sometimes lead to great misunderstandings. ""Yes"" may not mean 
              ""yes."" When the Vietnamese say ""No problem,"" you can take it to 
              mean ""Yes, there is a problem."" Double and even triple-check all 
              commitments, and then monitor them closely."
Vietnam,The People,"Your local partner in Vietnam is very important and should be 
              chosen very carefully."
Vietnam,The People,"Corruption is widespread. All manners of payoffs, kickbacks 
              and ""gifts"" are quite common. Be aware that corruption will not 
              only affect your costs, but also may contribute to unexpected 
              delays in delivery and the processing of licenses."
Vietnam,The People,Dining and Entertainment
Vietnam,The People,"A small dish or shaker of white crystal on the table is more 
              likely to be monosodium glutamate (MSG) than sugar or salt."
Vietnam,The People,"The Vietnamese style of dining is chopsticks and rice bowls. 
              Hold your rice bowl in your hand; it is considered lazy to eat 
              from a rice bowl that is on the table."
Vietnam,The People,"The host may serve guests, but will usually just invite 
              everyone to begin helping themselves. Food is placed on dishes in 
              the center of the table from which each person helps him/herself."
Vietnam,The People,"An offer of tea at a reception or meeting is a ritual form of 
              hospitality and should not be refused."
Vietnam,The People,Dress
Vietnam,The People,The Vietnamese dress very well.
Vietnam,The People,"For business, men should wear conservative but casual suits 
              and ties."
Vietnam,The People,"Women should wear a conservative dress or a businesslike 
              blouse and pants."
Vietnam,The People,Gifts
Vietnam,The People,Flowers are normally given only by men to women.
Vietnam,The People,Always wrap a gift in colorful paper.
Vietnam,The People,"When visiting a Vietnamese home, bring a gift for the hostess. 
              A gift for children or an elderly parent is also appreciated."
Vietnam,The People,"Give items useful for daily activity, like designer soaps, 
              cosmetics, lamps or framed pictures for the home."
Vietnam,The People,"Don't give handkerchiefs (symbols of a sad farewell). Most 
              Asians consider the Western habit of using a cloth handkerchief 
              and then returning it to your pocket to be barbaric."
Vietnam,The People,"In business, give whiskey. Giving a gift in an office setting 
              may be misinterpreted as a bribe. Try to save your business gift 
              giving until you are invited to your colleague's home."
Vietnam,The People,Helpful Hints
Vietnam,The People,"Walk quickly, and avoid eye contact on the street."
Vietnam,The People,"Refer to Ho Chi Minh City as Saigon. Local people prefer 
              Saigon to Ho Chi Minh City, which was imposed by the government in 
              Hanoi."
Vietnam,The People,Especially for Women
Vietnam,The People,"In the major cities, little sexual discrimination exists, and 
              Vietnamese women receive equal pay for equal work. In the country, 
              men are still boss."
Vietnam,The People,"Western women should dress conservatively in Vietnam. Women 
              who wear heavy makeup and revealing clothing are viewed as 
              prostitutes."
Vietnam,The People,"When dining with a Vietnamese man, a western businesswoman 
              should arrange to eat in a public place and should insist upon 
              hosting. If the Vietnamese man hosts, the Western woman is obliged 
              to reciprocate with a meal of equal value."
Vietnam,Meeting and Greeting,"The Vietnamese generally shake hands both when greeting and 
              when saying good-bye. Shake with both hands, and bow your head

Argentina,The People,"Argentines are very proud of their country and culture. They are 
            well-educated and sophisticated and like to be viewed as 
            cosmopolitan and progressive. Because 85% of Argentina’s population 
            hails from Italy, Spain, Austria, France, Germany, Great Britain, 
            Portugal, Russia, Switzerland, Poland and the Middle East, 
            Argentines tend to identify with Europeans. It has been said that 
            Argentines are a nation of Italians who speak Spanish and think 
            they’re British living in Paris. Predominantly Catholic (93%), 
            families are highly valued and hold conservative values."

            a great love for the outdoors (i.e., walking, skiing, climbing, 
            etc.). Although predominantly Catholic (89%), traditional family 
            values have been weakened by modern life and government legislation. 
            The rate of women working outside the home is one of the highest in 
            the industrialized world."

              leaving."
Austria,The People,"Viennese men may kiss the hand of a woman. Accept this

              women over 18 are Frau, even if they are not married."

Belgium,The People,"Belgium is comprised of two primary cultural groups. The 
            Dutch-speaking Flemings live in Flanders, in the north, and make up 
            55% of the population. The French-speaking Walloons live in 
            Wallonia, in the south, and make up 33% of the population. Hard work 
            and an appreciation for culture are important values to Belgians, 
            who think of themselves as Europeans first, Walloons or Flemings 
            second, and Belgians third. Strong family systems are vital to 
            Belgian society. Extended families live in separate homes, but often 
            settle in or near the town where they were raised."
Belgium,The People,Meeting and Greeting

Bolivia,The People,"Bolivians are very proud of being one of the few countries that 
            have successfully promoted multicultural integration. Vice President 
            Víctor Hugo Cárdenas, elected in 1993, was the first indigenous 
            person elected to this high office in South America. Bolivians are 
            kind, gentle people, who are concerned for each other's welfare. 
            Friendship is a very important value. The family is the central unit 
            in the social system. Education is valued, but still not achievable 
            for all people. Although it is legally compulsory for ages six to 
            14, fewer than half of all children finish primary education."

Brazil,The People,"Brazilians are friendly and free-spirited, with an incredible

Brazil,The People,"Brazilians are extremely casual about time. Being ten to

Brazil,The People,Especially for Men
Brazil,The People,"Brazilian women can be very aggressive romantically and forward 
            to the point of harassment. Don’t be surprised if you are in a 
            restaurant or nightclub and a woman sends you a note asking for your 
            phone number — even if you are with your wife or girlfriend. Foreign 
            men traveling to Brazil should be very cautious when dealing with

              or Rio."

              your mouth with your other hand."

Brazil,Body Language,Gifts
Brazil,Body Language,"Gifts are not important in establishing a business

Brazil,Body Language,Helpful Hints
Brazil,Body Language,"Don’t assume that the ""self-made"" businessperson is admired in 
              Brazil. Inherited wealth and a good family background are much 
              more desirable."
Brazil,Body Language,"Brazilians are extremely casual about time. Being ten to 
              fifteen minutes late in business is normal, and twenty to thirty 
              minutes late is not unusual. Be on time for a formal meeting, but 
              prepare to wait for your Brazilian colleagues."
Brazil,Body Language,"Soccer (football), family, Brazil’s beautiful beaches and the 
              country’s rapid growth are all appropriate conversation topics. 
              Politics, poverty, religion, Argentina (considered a rival) and 
              the deforestation of Brazil are not. Personal topics such as age, 
              salary and marital or job status are also unacceptable."
Brazil,Body Language,"Brazilians are expressive and passionate conversationalists. 
              Be prepared to be interrupted."
Brazil,Body Language,"Don’t smoke in public. Federal law bans smoking in public 
              places."
Brazil,Body Language,Don’t refer to Brazilians as Latins.
Brazil,Body Language,Especially for Women
Brazil,Body Language,"As women increasingly join the workforce, machismo has become 
            less common. Younger, better-educated women have values that 
            correspond closely to those of North American women. Women are 
            well-accepted and are prominent in education, medicine and 
            journalism and as small business owners."

              and personal lives."
Brazil,Body Language,"Foreign women will usually have no problem doing business in 
              Brazil. However, some people are still conservative in this

              too professional."
Brazil,Body Language,"It is traditional to invite someone for a drink after work. 
              This is not a come-on."
Brazil,Body Language,Especially for Men
Brazil,Body Language,"Brazilian women can be very aggressive romantically and forward 
            to the point of harassment. Don’t be surprised if you are in a 
            restaurant or nightclub and a woman sends you a note asking for your 
            phone number — even if you are with your wife or girlfriend. Foreign 
            men traveling to Brazil should be very cautious when dealing with 
            Brazilian women. If you don’t want the attention, be cordial but 
            keep your distance. Don’t be overly friendly."

Brazil,Corporate Culture,"Brazilians will do anything for friends, hence the expression: 
              ""For friends, everything. For enemies, the law."" Relationships are 
              more important than a legal document in business."
Brazil,Corporate Culture,"Meetings are conducted at a casual, unhurried pace. Don’t get 
              right down to business. Engage in conversation first."
Brazil,Corporate Culture,"Doing business with Brazilians requires face to face 
              communication. You will be able to do only limited business by 
              phone, fax or e-mail."
Brazil,Corporate Culture,"Some facts may not be completely accurate during the early 
              stages of business negotiations. Brazilians expect some initial 
              hype and will passionately argue their points, slowly and 
              grudgingly making concessions. Try to maintain consistency in your 
              negotiating team."
Brazil,Corporate Culture,"Always get a written agreement with starting date, time of 
              delivery, payment details, etc. Bill in advance."

Brazil,Corporate Culture,Stay at a first-class hotel. Appearances count.
Brazil,Corporate Culture,"Hire a Brazilian contact (a despachante) from your industry to

            correspond closely to those of North American women. Women are 
            well-accepted and are prominent in education, medicine and

Brazil,Gifts,Especially for Men
Brazil,Gifts,"Brazilian women can be very aggressive romantically and forward 
            to the point of harassment. Don’t be surprised if you are in a 
            restaurant or nightclub and a woman sends you a note asking for your 
            phone number — even if you are with your wife or girlfriend. Foreign 
            men traveling to Brazil should be very cautious when dealing with 
            Brazilian women. If you don’t want the attention, be cordial but 
            keep your distance. Don’t be overly friendly."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,"Don’t assume that the ""self-made"" businessperson is admired in 
              Brazil. Inherited wealth and a good family background are much 
              more desirable."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,"Brazilians are extremely casual about time. Being ten to 
              fifteen minutes late in business is normal, and twenty to thirty 
              minutes late is not unusual. Be on time for a formal meeting, but 
              prepare to wait for your Brazilian colleagues."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,"Soccer (football), family, Brazil’s beautiful beaches and the 
              country’s rapid growth are all appropriate conversation topics. 
              Politics, poverty, religion, Argentina (considered a rival) and 
              the deforestation of Brazil are not. Personal topics such as age, 
              salary and marital or job status are also unacceptable."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,"Brazilians are expressive and passionate conversationalists. 
              Be prepared to be interrupted."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,"Don’t smoke in public. Federal law bans smoking in public 
              places."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,Don’t refer to Brazilians as Latins.

Canada,The People,"The vast majority of Canadians claim European ancestry. Four in 
            nine Canadians claim some British ancestry and a little less than 
            one in three have some French ancestry. Eighty percent of the 
            residents in Quebec have French ancestry. Eighty percent of native 
            French speakers live in Quebec (the others are mostly in New 
            Brunswick, and parts of Ontario and Manitoba). Other European groups 
            include Italians, Germans and Ukrainians (especially in the prairie 
            states)."
Canada,The People,"Broadly speaking, Canada has been divided into two distinct 
            societies, one French-speaking (see ""Quebec"" below) and one 
            English-speaking. Because they don't form as cohesive a group as 
            French-speaking Canadians, only very general observations can be 
            made about English-speaking Canadians; they are generally thought of 
            (and consider themselves) more reserved, less aggressive and less 
            excitable than their neighbors to the south."
Canada,The People,"Most Canadians identify themselves very strongly with their 
            province. Canadians continue to wrestle with the question, ""What 
            does it mean to be Canadian?"" and take pains to differentiate 
            themselves from citizens of the United States."
Canada,The People,Regional Differences
Canada,The People,"Atlantic Canada (includes the Maritimes -- Nova Scotia, New 
            Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island -- and Newfoundland): Primarily 
            of British descent, the residents of the less prosperous Atlantic 
            provinces of eastern Canada are generally more reserved, stolid, 
            provincial and old-fashioned. Newfoundland is unique, with a dialect 
            and culture that draws comparisons with the Irish and the people of 
            western England."
Canada,The People,"Ontario: Residents of Canada's most populous province -- the 
            country's economic, political and cultural colossus -- are generally 
            thought of as more business-like and conservative than other 
            Canadians."
Canada,The People,"Western Canada (includes Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba): 
            Residents of Canada's western provinces are generally more open, 
            relaxed, friendly and direct than other Canadians (comparisons are 
            often made with inhabitants of the western United States)."
Canada,The People,"British Columbia: Canada's unconventional westernmost province is 
            seen by Canadians as the land of the future, and has more in common 
            with Seattle than Toronto. Like many other western Canadians, many 
            residents of British Columbia feel somewhat estranged from 
            ""easterners"" (a general code word for those from Ontario and 
            Quebec)."
Canada,The People,"Quebec (and other areas of Francophone Canada): French Canadians, 
            and especially the Québécois (or citizens of Quebec, pronounced 
            ""keh-beck-wah"") have a very strong sense of cultural identity and 
            are very nationalistic. The European influence is strongly felt in 
            Quebec, whose people consider themselves the ""defenders of French 
            civilization in North America."" Because of their animated good 
            nature, Québécois are sometimes called the ""Latins of the North."""
Canada,The People,"The North: Residents of the sparsely populated north are seen as 
            rugged embodiments of the Canadian pioneer spirit."
Canada,The People,Meeting and Greeting
Canada,The People,"In general, Canadians are more reserved and polite than 
              Americans, and take matters of etiquette a little more seriously."
Canada,The People,"Shake hands and introduce yourself when meeting Canadians for 
              the first time. Always shake hands firmly when meeting or 
              departing. Eye contact is important."
Canada,The People,"When a woman enters or leaves a room, it is polite for men to 
              rise. Men normally offer their hands to women."
Canada,The People,"In Quebec, kissing on the cheeks in the French manner is quite 
              common. When close friends and family meet in Quebec, they use 
              first names and kiss both cheeks."
Canada,The People,"An older French Canadian man may kiss the hand of a woman. 
              Accept this gesture graciously. A foreign man shouldn't kiss the 
              hand of a French Canadian woman, who would be quite shocked."
Canada,The People,"Canadians are somewhat more formal than Americans with regard 
              to names and titles. Use last names and appropriate titles until 
              invited by your Canadian hosts or colleagues to use their first 
              names. First names are normally used only by close friends and 
              family. Western Canadians may use first names more frequently than 
              other Canadians."
Canada,The People,"In Quebec, coworkers of similiar status generally use first 
              names in private, but always last names in public. The formal 
              ""you"" is almost always used in a business setting, even after 20 
              years."
Canada,The People,"Academic titles and degrees are important to French Canadians. 
              You should know and use them properly."
Canada,The People,Language
Canada,The People,"English and French are both official languages of business in 
              Canada. However, virtually all international business is conducted 
              in English."
Canada,The People,"Most French Canadians speak and understand English, but prefer 
              to use French. Check ahead of time to find out if an interpreter 
              will be necessary."
Canada,The People,Body Language
Canada,The People,"Generally speaking, Canadians are more reserved than 
              Americans. Canadians generally don't touch very much when 
              conversing. Maintaining a certain amount of personal space is 
              important."
Canada,The People,"French Canadians are generally more animated and expressive 
              than other Canadians."
Canada,The People,Take off your hat or sunglasses when speaking with someone.
Canada,The People,"Some gestures have different meanings in Quebec. For example, 
              ""thumbs down"" is considered offensive in Quebec, as is slapping an 
              open palm over a closed fist. Like the rest of their countrymen 
              and women, French-Canadians use the ""thumbs up"" sign to mean 
              ""okay. ""The ""okay"" sign made with the index finger and thumb means 
              ""zero"" in Quebec."
Canada,The People,"In Quebec, sit straight with your legs crossed at the knee, or 
              with your knees together. Don't sit with your legs apart, or with 
              your feet propped up on tables or chairs."
Canada,The People,"It's considered bad form by many in Quebec to talk with your 
              hands in your pockets."
Canada,The People,"Sneeze or blow your nose as quietly as possible using a 
              handkerchief or tissue. If possible, leave the room. Do not yawn 
              or scratch in public. Toothpicks, nail clippers, and combs are 
              never used in public."
Canada,The People,Corporate Culture
Canada,The People,"Punctuality is demanded for business meetings and social 
              occasions. If a conflict arises, you are expected to let your 
              Canadian counterpart know immediately. That said, Canadians are 
              not as obsessed with time as Americans."
Canada,The People,Business cards are commonly exchanged in Canada.
Canada,The People,"For Quebec, print your business cards in English or French, 
              including your academic degree(s) and/or title. A double-sided 
              business card (one side in English, one side in French) is best."
Canada,The People,"Canadians get down to business quickly. Meetings are 
              well-organized, and extraneous discussion is kept to a minimum. A 
              premium is placed on time."
Canada,The People,"Business communication is quite direct in Canada, but more 
              reserved than in the United States. Letters and telephone calls 
              should be direct and succinct. Pleasantries are dispensed with 
              very quickly."
Canada,The People,"Business culture varies somewhat throughout Canada, depending 
              on the region."
Canada,The People,"Although the relationship between Canada and the United States 
              is generally quite good, some Canadians may be wary about the 
              intentions of American businesses and put off by what they 
              perceive as American arrogance. Some Canadians may dislike the 
              American ""hard sell"" approach."
Canada,The People,Dining and Entertainment
Canada,The People,"To beckon a waiter in Quebec, quietly to say ""Monsieur"" or 
              ""S'il vous plait. Say ""Mademoiselle"" to beckon a waitress. Never 
              beckon a waiter or waitress by snapping your fingers or shouting."
Canada,The People,"The host normally offers first toast. Wait until everyone is 
              served wine and a toast is proposed before drinking. It is 
              acceptable for women to propose a toast."
Canada,The People,Wine is normally served with meals in Quebec.
Canada,The People,"In Quebec, it's considered bad form to ask for a martini or 
              scotch before dinner — French Canadians consider them ""palate 
              numbing."" Typical before-dinner drinks include Pernod, kir, 
              champagne, and vermouth. Cognac, Grand Marnier and/or other 
              liqueurs are served after dinner."
Canada,The People,"Business entertainment is common, but the focus usually 
              remains on business. The person who invites is normally expected 
              to pay."
Canada,The People,"Etiquette and formalities are more important in Canada than in 
              the United States."
Canada,The People,"While continental-style table manners are employed in Quebec, 
              American style table manners are seen in other parts of the 
              country."
Canada,The People,"Eating while walking or standing on the street in Quebec is 
              considered bad form."
Canada,The People,"Never arrive early for a social occasion. Opt, instead, for 
              being ""fashionably late."" Showing up early at a bar or disco in 
              Quebec (at, say, 10 o'clock) immediately marks you as an ""Anglo."""
Canada,The People,Dress
Canada,The People,"Generally speaking, Canadians dress more conservatively (and 
              more formally when going out) than their American neighbors, 
              although practices vary by region. Dress in Vancouver, for 
              example, is somewhat more casual; in Toronto more British. French 
              Canadians dress in a more relaxed European style than their fellow 
              Canadians."
Canada,The People,"For business meetings, men should wear suits and ties; women 
              should wear conservative suits or dresses."
Canada,The People,Gifts
Canada,The People,"Bring flowers, fine wine or chocolates for the hostess when 
              invited to a Canadian home. Avoid red roses (associated with 
              romantic love) and white lilies (associated with funerals)."
Canada,The People,Helpful Hints
Canada,The People,"Do your homework about Canada. Most Americans are appallingly 
              ignorant of Canadian history, culture and geography."
Canada,The People,"Recognize that important regional differences exist in Canada 
              and prepare to adapt."
Canada,The People,"When in Quebec, learn a little French; Québécois greatly 
              appreciate it when you take the effort to talk to them in their 
              native language."
Canada,The People,Do not compare Canada with the United States.
Canada,The People,"Do not use the term ""Native Americans"" to refer to indigenous 
              peoples. Many Canadians find the term offensive. Canadians refer 
              to members of these groups as ""people of the First Nations."""
Canada,The People,"Do not take sides in debates about contentious national issues 
              (especially when they concern such issues the status of Quebec, 
              the place of the French and English languages in Canadian society, 
              etc.)."

              intentions of American businesses and put off by what they 
              perceive as American arrogance. Some Canadians may dislike the 
              American ""hard sell"" approach."

Canada,Corporate Culture,"Business communication is quite direct in Canada, but more 
              reserved than in the United States. Letters and telephone calls

Chile,The People,"Chileans are very nationalistic and are proud of their country, 
            as well as of their literacy -- the 95% rate puts them among the 
            best educated in the world. Predominantly Roman Catholic (89%), 
            family is the primary structure of society. The father is still 
            considered the head of the family, but the mother is an important 
            decision-maker. People are judged by their educational and family 
            backgrounds, not by race."
Chile,The People,Meeting and Greeting
Chile,The People,"Chileans are very warm and expect visitors to reciprocate. 
              They may be formal at first, but move to friendship very quickly."

Chile,The People,"Chileans don’t like to feel pressured or rushed. Business may 
              be conducted more slowly than in Europe and North America."
Chile,The People,"Expertise is less important than your personal, family and 
              company background. Family and friendship play a big role in 
              business, and whom one knows is important. Red tape can be 
              minimized considerably if you have the right connections."

              doing business in Chile. Some light conversation is customary 
              before getting down to business."
Chile,The People,"Decision-making is centralized and decisions are made at the 
              top level, although all levels have input. Visit top-level 
              executives first. Mid-level executives can follow up on subsequent

              screeners for their bosses."

              finish a business transaction."
Chile,The People,"It is acceptable, but not yet common, to communicate via 
              e-mail; don’t expect a quick response."
Chile,The People,"Businesslike behavior with a bit of humor is appreciated. Do 
              not attempt a hard sell approach, and avoid aggressive behavior."

              careful not to speak with food in your mouth."
Chile,The People,"Never leave immediately after dinner. Stay for conversation 
              after the meal."
Chile,The People,"An invitation for drinks at a private home generally includes 
              dinner. Guests should reciprocate with comparable hospitality at a 
              later time."
Chile,The People,"There are no separate checks. The person who invites pays. 
              Arrange in advance to pay the bill in a restaurant if you are the 
              host. You will not be presented with a bill in a restaurant until 
              you ask for it."

              thirty minutes late for dinner and thirty minutes late for a party 
              is customary."

Chile,The People,"Do not talk about politics or human rights, especially as a 
              foreigner, unless your host initiates the discussion."
Chile,The People,"When smoking, offer a cigarette to everyone. Chileans have a 
              saying for those who neglect to share: ""Did you learn to smoke in 
              jail?"""
Chile,The People,Especially for Women
Chile,The People,"Traditionally, men have dominated private and public life in 
            Chile. However, attitudes are changing at home and in the workplace. 
            Women now make up 30% of the labor. In addition, many women hold

China,The People,"Deeply rooted in Chinese society is the need to belong and 
            conform to a unit, whether the family, a political party or an 
            organization. The family is the focus of life for most Chinese. Age 
            and rank are highly respected. However, to the dismay of older 
            people, today's young people are rapidly modernizing, wearing blue 
            jeans and sunglasses, drinking Coke and driving motorbikes."
China,The People,Meeting and Greeting
China,The People,"Shake hands upon meeting. Chinese may nod or bow instead of 
              shaking hands, although shaking hands has become increasingly 
              common."
China,The People,"When introduced to a Chinese group, they may greet you with 
              applause. Applaud back."
China,The People,"Senior persons begin greetings. Greet the oldest, most senior 
              person before others. During group introductions, line up 
              according to seniority with the senior person at the head of the 
              line."
China,The People,Names and Titles
China,The People,"Use family names and appropriate titles until specifically 
              invited by your Chinese host or colleagues to use their given 
              names."
China,The People,"Address the Chinese by Mr., Mrs., Miss plus family name. Note: 
              married women always retain their maiden name."
China,The People,"Chinese are often addressed by their government or 
              professional titles. For example, address Li Pang using his title: 
              Mayor Li or Director Li."
China,The People,"Names may have two parts; for example: Wang Chien. Traditional 
              Chinese family names are placed first with the given name (which 
              has one or two syllables) coming last (family name: Wang; given: 
              Chien)."
China,The People,"Chinese generally introduce their guests using their full 
              titles and company names. You should do the same. Example: Doctor 
              John Smith, CEO of American Data Corporation."
China,The People,Body Language
China,The People,"The Chinese dislike being touched by strangers. Do not touch, 
              hug, lock arms, back slap or make any body contact."
China,The People,Clicking fingers or whistling is considered very rude.
China,The People,"Never put your feet on a desk or a chair. Never gesture or 
              pass an object with your feet."
China,The People,"Blowing one's nose in a handkerchief and returning it to one's 
              pocket is considered vulgar by the Chinese."
China,The People,"To beckon a Chinese person, face the palm of your hand 
              downward and move your fingers in a scratching motion. Never use 
              your index finger to beckon anyone."
China,The People,"Sucking air in quickly and loudly through lips and teeth 
              expresses distress or surprise at a proposed request. Attempt to 
              change your request, allowing the Chinese to save face."
China,The People,"Chinese point with an open hand. Never point with your index 
              finger."
China,The People,Corporate Culture
China,The People,"The Chinese are practical in business and realize they need 
            Western investment, but dislike dependency on foreigners. They are 
            suspicious and fearful of being cheated or pushed around by 
            foreigners, who are perceived as culturally and economically 
            corrupt. It is very difficult to break through the ""them vs. us"" 
            philosophy (foreign partner vs. Chinese). In personal relationships, 
            the Chinese will offer friendship and warm hospitality without 
            conflict, but in business they are astute negotiators."
China,The People,"Punctuality is important for foreign businesspeople. Being 
              late is rude. Meetings always begin on time."
China,The People,"Business cards are exchanged upon meeting. Business cards 
              should be printed in English on one side and Chinese on the other. 
              Make sure the Chinese side uses ""simplified"" characters and not 
              ""classical"" characters, which are used in Taiwan and Hong Kong."
China,The People,"English is not spoken in business meetings, although some 
              Chinese may understand English without making it known. Hire an 
              interpreter or ask for one to be provided."
China,The People,"Be prepared for long meetings and lengthy negotiations (often 
              ten days straight) with many delays."
China,The People,"The Chinese will enter a meeting with the highest-ranking 
              person entering first. They will assume the first member of your 
              group to enter the room is the leader of your delegation. The 
              senior Chinese person welcomes everyone. The foreign leader 
              introduces his/her team, and each member distributes his/her card. 
              The leader invites the Chinese to do the same."
China,The People,"Seating is very important at a meeting. The host sits to the 
              left of the most important guest."
China,The People,"There may be periods of silence at a business meeting; do not 
              interrupt these."
China,The People,"A contract is considered a draft subject to change. Chinese 
              may agree on a deal and then change their minds. A signed contract 
              is not binding and does not mean negotiations will end."
China,The People,"Observing seniority and rank are extremely important in 
              business."
China,The People,"The status of the people who make the initial contact with the 
              Chinese is very important. Don't insult the Chinese by sending 
              someone with a low rank."
China,The People,"Chinese negotiators may try to make foreign negotiators feel 
              guilty about setbacks; they may then manipulate this sense of 
              guilt to achieve certain concessions."
China,The People,"Two Chinese negotiating tricks designed to make you agree to 
              concessions are staged temper tantrums and a feigned sense of 
              urgency."
China,The People,"If the Chinese side no longer wishes to pursue the deal, they 
              may not tell you. To save their own face, they may become 
              increasingly inflexible and hard-nosed, forcing you to break off 
              negotiations. In this way, they may avoid blame for the failure."
China,The People,Dining and Entertainment
China,The People,"Dining is used to probe positions without any formal 
              commitment. Business is generally not discussed during meals. 
              Meals are a vehicle for indirect business references."
China,The People,"The Chinese are superb hosts. Twelve-course banquets with 
              frequent toasts are a Chinese trademark."
China,The People,"The Chinese sponsoring organization generally hosts a 
              welcoming banquet. Foreign guests should reciprocate toward the 
              end of their visits. Invite everyone with whom you have dealt."
China,The People,"Always arrive exactly on time for a banquet. Never arrive 
              early for dinner. This implies that you are hungry and might cause 
              you to lose face."
China,The People,"Spouses are not usually included in business entertaining, 
              however, businesspeople may bring their secretaries."
China,The People,Be prepared to make a small toast for all occasions.
China,The People,"The first toast normally occurs during or after the first 
              course, not before. After the next course, the guest should 
              reciprocate."
China,The People,"Three glasses -- a large one for beer, soda or mineral water, 
              a small wine glass and a stemmed shot glass -- are at each place 
              setting. The shot glass is the one used for toasting."
China,The People,"It is not necessary to always drain your glass after a ganbei 
              (bottoms up), although a host should encourage it."
China,The People,"Do not drink until you toast others at the table. Chinese 
              consider drinking alone to be rude. Simply raising your glass and 
              making eye contact is sufficient. If you are toasted, sip your 
              drink in reply."
China,The People,"A toast to friendship among companies will help cement a 
              business relationship."
China,The People,"Unless you are totally drunk, it is not advised to refuse a 
              drink. Sipping your drink is perfectly acceptable."
China,The People,"Leave some food on your plate during each course of a meal to 
              honor the generosity of your host. It is bad manners for a Chinese 
              host not to keep refilling guests' plates or teacups."
China,The People,"Seating is very important. The guest of honor is always placed 
              at the head of the room, facing the door. Allow the host to begin 
              eating before joining in."
China,The People,"Do not discuss business at dinner unless your Chinese 
              counterpart initiates it."
China,The People,"Slurping soup and belching are acceptable. Cover your mouth 
              with your hand when using a toothpick. Put bones, seeds, etc. on 
              the table, never in your rice bowl."
China,The People,"Chopsticks are used for all meals. Tapping your chopsticks on 
              the table is considered very rude."
China,The People,"When finished eating, place your chopsticks neatly on the 
              table or on the chopstick rest."
China,The People,"When hosting, order one dish for every person present and one 
              extra. In addition, order rice, noodles and buns. Soup usually 
              comes at some point during the meal. The host should tell his/her 
              guests to begin eating a new dish before he digs in himself."
China,The People,The host (the one who invites) pays the bill for everyone.
China,The People,"If you are the guest of honor at a dinner, leave shortly after 
              the meal is finished, as no one will leave before the guest of 
              honor."
China,The People,"Breakfast meetings are rare, but you may request one."
China,The People,"Guests are rarely invited to a Chinese home. It is an honor to 
              be a guest. Be on time or a little early for an invitation, and 
              take a small gift."
China,The People,"Bedrooms and kitchens are private. Don't enter these rooms 
              unless you are invited to do so."
China,The People,"All dishes are served at once in a home. The host will place 
              portions of each dish on guests' plates. Sample each dish."
China,The People,Rare beef is considered barbaric by the Chinese.
China,The People,Dress
China,The People,"Conservative, simple, unpretentious, modest clothing should be 
              worn -- nothing flashy or overly fashionable."
China,The People,"Women should avoid bare backs, shorts, low-cut tops and 
              excessive jewelry."
China,The People,"For business, men should wear sport coats and ties. Slacks and 
              open-necked shirts are generally suitable in the summer for 
              business meetings; jackets and ties are not necessary."
China,The People,"Women should wear dresses or pantsuits for business and should 
              avoid heavy make-up and dangling, gaudy jewelry."
China,The People,Gifts
China,The People,"Present a gift with both hands. Gifts are generally not opened 
              upon receiving. Always give a gift to everyone present or don't 
              give gifts at all."
China,The People,"Older Chinese usually refuse a gift at first to be polite. 
              Offer a second time."
China,The People,"Never give a gift of great value until a clear relationship is 
              established. This would cause embarrassment and may not be 
              accepted. Never give gifts in sets (i.e., dishes), but never in 
              sets of four (a number associated with death)."
China,The People,"Avoid white, which is symbolic of death, especially of 
              parents, and black, which symbolizes tragedy or death."
China,The People,"When invited to someone's home, always bring a small gift for 
              the hostess, such as brandy, chocolates or cakes."
China,The People,"Be prepared to exchange a modest gift with your business 
              colleagues at the first meeting. Not giving a gift could start a 
              business meeting off on the wrong foot."
China,The People,"Always give gifts to each member of the Chinese delegation 
              that meets you in the order in which they were introduced. 
              Suggested gifts: cigarettes (especially Marlboro and Kent), French 
              brandy, whiskey, pens, lighters, desk attire, cognac, books, 
              framed paintings. Give more valuable gifts — like cellular phones 
              or small CD players — to senior level people."
China,The People,"Give a group gift from your company to the host company. 
              Present this gift to the leader of the delegation."
China,The People,Helpful Hints
China,The People,"Chinese find ""no"" difficult to say. They may say ""maybe"" or 
              ""we'll see"" in order to save face."
China,The People,"Always refer to China as ""China"" or ""People's Republic of 
              China,"" never as ""Red China,"" ""Communist China"" or ""Mainland 
              China."""
China,The People,"Always refer to Taiwan as ""Taiwan"" or ""Province of Taiwan,"" 
              never ""China,"" ""Republic of China"" (the name adapted by the 
              Nationalist forces after they fled to Taiwan) or ""Free China."""
China,The People,Do not in any way suggest that Taiwan is not part of China.
China,The People,"Show respect for older people. Offer a seat or right of way 
              through the door to a colleague or older person as a polite 
              gesture."
China,The People,Return applause when applauded.
China,The People,"Refrain from being loud, boisterous or showy."
China,The People,"Do not be insulted if the Chinese ask personal questions such 
              as ""How much money do you make?"" ""How many children do you have?"" 
              or ""Are you married?"" Just change the subject if you do not want 
              to answer."
China,The People,"Asking about divorce would cause a Chinese person to lose 
              face."
China,The People,"Forcing the Chinese to say ""no"" will quickly end a 
              relationship."
China,The People,"Never say or act like you are starving and don’t ask for a 
              doggy bag."
China,The People,"Most Chinese women don't wear wedding rings. Don't assume 
              marital status."
China,The People,Especially for Women
China,The People,"China is a difficult place for anyone to conduct business. A 
              woman may gain acceptance, but it will take time and will not be 
              easy."
China,The People,"China is a male-dominated society. However, there are many 
              women in business in China and some occupy high-ranking positions 
              and important managerial jobs. One of the principles of the 
              Chinese communist system is to work toward sexual equality."
China,The People,"Negotiating teams may have women members. Women may be used to 
              decline unpopular proposals."
China,The People,"Businesswomen attend business dinners, but rarely bring their 
              spouses."
China,The People,"Chinese women rarely smoke or drink. However, it is acceptable 
              for Western women to do so moderately."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Shake hands upon meeting. Chinese may nod or bow instead of 
              shaking hands, although shaking hands has become increasingly 
              common."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"When introduced to a Chinese group, they may greet you with 
              applause. Applaud back."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Senior persons begin greetings. Greet the oldest, most senior 
              person before others. During group introductions, line up 
              according to seniority with the senior person at the head of the 
              line."
China,Meeting and Greeting,Names and Titles
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Use family names and appropriate titles until specifically 
              invited by your Chinese host or colleagues to use their given 
              names."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Address the Chinese by Mr., Mrs., Miss plus family name. Note: 
              married women always retain their maiden name."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Chinese are often addressed by their government or 
              professional titles. For example, address Li Pang using his title: 
              Mayor Li or Director Li."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Names may have two parts; for example: Wang Chien. Traditional 
              Chinese family names are placed first with the given name (which 
              has one or two syllables) coming last (family name: Wang; given: 
              Chien)."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Chinese generally introduce their guests using their full 
              titles and company names. You should do the same. Example: Doctor 
              John Smith, CEO of American Data Corporation."
China,Meeting and Greeting,Body Language
China,Meeting and Greeting,"The Chinese dislike being touched by strangers. Do not touch, 
              hug, lock arms, back slap or make any body contact."
China,Meeting and Greeting,Clicking fingers or whistling is considered very rude.
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Never put your feet on a desk or a chair. Never gesture or 
              pass an object with your feet."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Blowing one's nose in a handkerchief and returning it to one's 
              pocket is considered vulgar by the Chinese."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"To beckon a Chinese person, face the palm of your hand 
              downward and move your fingers in a scratching motion. Never use 
              your index finger to beckon anyone."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Sucking air in quickly and loudly through lips and teeth 
              expresses distress or surprise at a proposed request. Attempt to 
              change your request, allowing the Chinese to save face."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Chinese point with an open hand. Never point with your index 
              finger."
China,Meeting and Greeting,Corporate Culture
China,Meeting and Greeting,"The Chinese are practical in business and realize they need 
            Western investment, but dislike dependency on foreigners. They are 
            suspicious and fearful of being cheated or pushed around by 
            foreigners, who are perceived as culturally and economically 
            corrupt. It is very difficult to break through the ""them vs. us"" 
            philosophy (foreign partner vs. Chinese). In personal relationships, 
            the Chinese will offer friendship and warm hospitality without 
            conflict, but in business they are astute negotiators."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Punctuality is important for foreign businesspeople. Being 
              late is rude. Meetings always begin on time."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Business cards are exchanged upon meeting. Business cards 
              should be printed in English on one side and Chinese on the other. 
              Make sure the Chinese side uses ""simplified"" characters and not 
              ""classical"" characters, which are used in Taiwan and Hong Kong."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"English is not spoken in business meetings, although some 
              Chinese may understand English without making it known. Hire an 
              interpreter or ask for one to be provided."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Be prepared for long meetings and lengthy negotiations (often 
              ten days straight) with many delays."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"The Chinese will enter a meeting with the highest-ranking 
              person entering first. They will assume the first member of your 
              group to enter the room is the leader of your delegation. The 
              senior Chinese person welcomes everyone. The foreign leader 
              introduces his/her team, and each member distributes his/her card. 
              The leader invites the Chinese to do the same."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Seating is very important at a meeting. The host sits to the 
              left of the most important guest."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"There may be periods of silence at a business meeting; do not 
              interrupt these."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"A contract is considered a draft subject to change. Chinese 
              may agree on a deal and then change their minds. A signed contract 
              is not binding and does not mean negotiations will end."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Observing seniority and rank are extremely important in 
              business."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"The status of the people who make the initial contact with the 
              Chinese is very important. Don't insult the Chinese by sending 
              someone with a low rank."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Chinese negotiators may try to make foreign negotiators feel 
              guilty about setbacks; they may then manipulate this sense of 
              guilt to achieve certain concessions."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Two Chinese negotiating tricks designed to make you agree to 
              concessions are staged temper tantrums and a feigned sense of 
              urgency."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"If the Chinese side no longer wishes to pursue the deal, they 
              may not tell you. To save their own face, they may become 
              increasingly inflexible and hard-nosed, forcing you to break off 
              negotiations. In this way, they may avoid blame for the failure."
China,Meeting and Greeting,Dining and Entertainment
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Dining is used to probe positions without any formal 
              commitment. Business is generally not discussed during meals. 
              Meals are a vehicle for indirect business references."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"The Chinese are superb hosts. Twelve-course banquets with 
              frequent toasts are a Chinese trademark."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"The Chinese sponsoring organization generally hosts a 
              welcoming banquet. Foreign guests should reciprocate toward the 
              end of their visits. Invite everyone with whom you have dealt."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Always arrive exactly on time for a banquet. Never arrive 
              early for dinner. This implies that you are hungry and might cause 
              you to lose face."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Spouses are not usually included in business entertaining, 
              however, businesspeople may bring their secretaries."
China,Meeting and Greeting,Be prepared to make a small toast for all occasions.
China,Meeting and Greeting,"The first toast normally occurs during or after the first 
              course, not before. After the next course, the guest should 
              reciprocate."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Three glasses -- a large one for beer, soda or mineral water, 
              a small wine glass and a stemmed shot glass -- are at each place 
              setting. The shot glass is the one used for toasting."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"It is not necessary to always drain your glass after a ganbei 
              (bottoms up), although a host should encourage it."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Do not drink until you toast others at the table. Chinese 
              consider drinking alone to be rude. Simply raising your glass and 
              making eye contact is sufficient. If you are toasted, sip your 
              drink in reply."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"A toast to friendship among companies will help cement a 
              business relationship."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Unless you are totally drunk, it is not advised to refuse a 
              drink. Sipping your drink is perfectly acceptable."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Leave some food on your plate during each course of a meal to 
              honor the generosity of your host. It is bad manners for a Chinese 
              host not to keep refilling guests' plates or teacups."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Seating is very important. The guest of honor is always placed 
              at the head of the room, facing the door. Allow the host to begin 
              eating before joining in."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Do not discuss business at dinner unless your Chinese 
              counterpart initiates it."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Slurping soup and belching are acceptable. Cover your mouth 
              with your hand when using a toothpick. Put bones, seeds, etc. on 
              the table, never in your rice bowl."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Chopsticks are used for all meals. Tapping your chopsticks on 
              the table is considered very rude."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"When finished eating, place your chopsticks neatly on the 
              table or on the chopstick rest."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"When hosting, order one dish for every person present and one 
              extra. In addition, order rice, noodles and buns. Soup usually 
              comes at some point during the meal. The host should tell his/her 
              guests to begin eating a new dish before he digs in himself."
China,Meeting and Greeting,The host (the one who invites) pays the bill for everyone.
China,Meeting and Greeting,"If you are the guest of honor at a dinner, leave shortly after 
              the meal is finished, as no one will leave before the guest of 
              honor."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Breakfast meetings are rare, but you may request one."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Guests are rarely invited to a Chinese home. It is an honor to 
              be a guest. Be on time or a little early for an invitation, and 
              take a small gift."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Bedrooms and kitchens are private. Don't enter these rooms 
              unless you are invited to do so."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"All dishes are served at once in a home. The host will place 
              portions of each dish on guests' plates. Sample each dish."
China,Meeting and Greeting,Rare beef is considered barbaric by the Chinese.
China,Meeting and Greeting,Dress
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Conservative, simple, unpretentious, modest clothing should be 
              worn -- nothing flashy or overly fashionable."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Women should avoid bare backs, shorts, low-cut tops and 
              excessive jewelry."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"For business, men should wear sport coats and ties. Slacks and 
              open-necked shirts are generally suitable in the summer for 
              business meetings; jackets and ties are not necessary."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Women should wear dresses or pantsuits for business and should 
              avoid heavy make-up and dangling, gaudy jewelry."
China,Meeting and Greeting,Gifts
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Present a gift with both hands. Gifts are generally not opened 
              upon receiving. Always give a gift to everyone present or don't 
              give gifts at all."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Older Chinese usually refuse a gift at first to be polite. 
              Offer a second time."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Never give a gift of great value until a clear relationship is 
              established. This would cause embarrassment and may not be 
              accepted. Never give gifts in sets (i.e., dishes), but never in 
              sets of four (a number associated with death)."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Avoid white, which is symbolic of death, especially of 
              parents, and black, which symbolizes tragedy or death."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"When invited to someone's home, always bring a small gift for 
              the hostess, such as brandy, chocolates or cakes."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Be prepared to exchange a modest gift with your business 
              colleagues at the first meeting. Not giving a gift could start a 
              business meeting off on the wrong foot."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Always give gifts to each member of the Chinese delegation 
              that meets you in the order in which they were introduced. 
              Suggested gifts: cigarettes (especially Marlboro and Kent), French 
              brandy, whiskey, pens, lighters, desk attire, cognac, books, 
              framed paintings. Give more valuable gifts — like cellular phones 
              or small CD players — to senior level people."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Give a group gift from your company to the host company. 
              Present this gift to the leader of the delegation."

China,Meeting and Greeting,Do not in any way suggest that Taiwan is not part of China.
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Show respect for older people. Offer a seat or right of way

              (bottoms up), although a host should encourage it."
China,Names and Titles,"Do not drink until you toast others at the table. Chinese 
              consider drinking alone to be rude. Simply raising your glass and 
              making eye contact is sufficient. If you are toasted, sip your 
              drink in reply."

China,Names and Titles,"Seating is very important. The guest of honor is always placed

              the table, never in your rice bowl."

              table or on the chopstick rest."
China,Names and Titles,"When hosting, order one dish for every person present and one 
              extra. In addition, order rice, noodles and buns. Soup usually

              guests to begin eating a new dish before he digs in himself."
China,Names and Titles,The host (the one who invites) pays the bill for everyone.
China,Names and Titles,"If you are the guest of honor at a dinner, leave shortly after

              excessive jewelry."

              Offer a second time."

              sets of four (a number associated with death)."

              the hostess, such as brandy, chocolates or cakes."

China,Names and Titles,"Always give gifts to each member of the Chinese delegation 
              that meets you in the order in which they were introduced.

              brandy, whiskey, pens, lighters, desk attire, cognac, books,

              Present this gift to the leader of the delegation."

              China,"" never as ""Red China,"" ""Communist China"" or ""Mainland 
              China."""
China,Names and Titles,"Always refer to Taiwan as ""Taiwan"" or ""Province of Taiwan,"" 
              never ""China,"" ""Republic of China"" (the name adapted by the

China,Names and Titles,Especially for Women
China,Names and Titles,"China is a difficult place for anyone to conduct business. A 
              woman may gain acceptance, but it will take time and will not be 
              easy."
China,Names and Titles,"China is a male-dominated society. However, there are many 
              women in business in China and some occupy high-ranking positions 
              and important managerial jobs. One of the principles of the 
              Chinese communist system is to work toward sexual equality."

              decline unpopular proposals."
China,Names and Titles,"Businesswomen attend business dinners, but rarely bring their

              downward and move your fingers in a scratching motion. Never use 
              your index finger to beckon anyone."
China,Body Language,"Sucking air in quickly and loudly through lips and teeth 
              expresses distress or surprise at a proposed request. Attempt to 
              change your request, allowing the Chinese to save face."
China,Body Language,"Chinese point with an open hand. Never point with your index 
              finger."
China,Body Language,Corporate Culture
China,Body Language,"The Chinese are practical in business and realize they need 
            Western investment, but dislike dependency on foreigners. They are 
            suspicious and fearful of being cheated or pushed around by 
            foreigners, who are perceived as culturally and economically 
            corrupt. It is very difficult to break through the ""them vs. us"" 
            philosophy (foreign partner vs. Chinese). In personal relationships, 
            the Chinese will offer friendship and warm hospitality without 
            conflict, but in business they are astute negotiators."
China,Body Language,"Punctuality is important for foreign businesspeople. Being 
              late is rude. Meetings always begin on time."
China,Body Language,"Business cards are exchanged upon meeting. Business cards 
              should be printed in English on one side and Chinese on the other. 
              Make sure the Chinese side uses ""simplified"" characters and not 
              ""classical"" characters, which are used in Taiwan and Hong Kong."
China,Body Language,"English is not spoken in business meetings, although some 
              Chinese may understand English without making it known. Hire an 
              interpreter or ask for one to be provided."
China,Body Language,"Be prepared for long meetings and lengthy negotiations (often 
              ten days straight) with many delays."
China,Body Language,"The Chinese will enter a meeting with the highest-ranking 
              person entering first. They will assume the first member of your 
              group to enter the room is the leader of your delegation. The 
              senior Chinese person welcomes everyone. The foreign leader 
              introduces his/her team, and each member distributes his/her card. 
              The leader invites the Chinese to do the same."
China,Body Language,"Seating is very important at a meeting. The host sits to the 
              left of the most important guest."
China,Body Language,"There may be periods of silence at a business meeting; do not 
              interrupt these."
China,Body Language,"A contract is considered a draft subject to change. Chinese 
              may agree on a deal and then change their minds. A signed contract 
              is not binding and does not mean negotiations will end."
China,Body Language,"Observing seniority and rank are extremely important in 
              business."
China,Body Language,"The status of the people who make the initial contact with the 
              Chinese is very important. Don't insult the Chinese by sending 
              someone with a low rank."
China,Body Language,"Chinese negotiators may try to make foreign negotiators feel 
              guilty about setbacks; they may then manipulate this sense of 
              guilt to achieve certain concessions."
China,Body Language,"Two Chinese negotiating tricks designed to make you agree to 
              concessions are staged temper tantrums and a feigned sense of 
              urgency."
China,Body Language,"If the Chinese side no longer wishes to pursue the deal, they 
              may not tell you. To save their own face, they may become 
              increasingly inflexible and hard-nosed, forcing you to break off 
              negotiations. In this way, they may avoid blame for the failure."
China,Body Language,Dining and Entertainment
China,Body Language,"Dining is used to probe positions without any formal 
              commitment. Business is generally not discussed during meals. 
              Meals are a vehicle for indirect business references."

              frequent toasts are a Chinese trademark."
China,Body Language,"The Chinese sponsoring organization generally hosts a 
              welcoming banquet. Foreign guests should reciprocate toward the 
              end of their visits. Invite everyone with whom you have dealt."
China,Body Language,"Always arrive exactly on time for a banquet. Never arrive 
              early for dinner. This implies that you are hungry and might cause 
              you to lose face."

China,Corporate Culture,"Seating is very important at a meeting. The host sits to the 
              left of the most important guest."
China,Corporate Culture,"There may be periods of silence at a business meeting; do not 
              interrupt these."
China,Corporate Culture,"A contract is considered a draft subject to change. Chinese 
              may agree on a deal and then change their minds. A signed contract 
              is not binding and does not mean negotiations will end."
China,Corporate Culture,"Observing seniority and rank are extremely important in 
              business."
China,Corporate Culture,"The status of the people who make the initial contact with the 
              Chinese is very important. Don't insult the Chinese by sending 
              someone with a low rank."
China,Corporate Culture,"Chinese negotiators may try to make foreign negotiators feel 
              guilty about setbacks; they may then manipulate this sense of 
              guilt to achieve certain concessions."
China,Corporate Culture,"Two Chinese negotiating tricks designed to make you agree to 
              concessions are staged temper tantrums and a feigned sense of 
              urgency."
China,Corporate Culture,"If the Chinese side no longer wishes to pursue the deal, they 
              may not tell you. To save their own face, they may become 
              increasingly inflexible and hard-nosed, forcing you to break off 
              negotiations. In this way, they may avoid blame for the failure."
China,Corporate Culture,Dining and Entertainment
China,Corporate Culture,"Dining is used to probe positions without any formal 
              commitment. Business is generally not discussed during meals. 
              Meals are a vehicle for indirect business references."
China,Corporate Culture,"The Chinese are superb hosts. Twelve-course banquets with 
              frequent toasts are a Chinese trademark."
China,Corporate Culture,"The Chinese sponsoring organization generally hosts a 
              welcoming banquet. Foreign guests should reciprocate toward the 
              end of their visits. Invite everyone with whom you have dealt."
China,Corporate Culture,"Always arrive exactly on time for a banquet. Never arrive 
              early for dinner. This implies that you are hungry and might cause 
              you to lose face."
China,Corporate Culture,"Spouses are not usually included in business entertaining, 
              however, businesspeople may bring their secretaries."
China,Corporate Culture,Be prepared to make a small toast for all occasions.
China,Corporate Culture,"The first toast normally occurs during or after the first 
              course, not before. After the next course, the guest should 
              reciprocate."
China,Corporate Culture,"Three glasses -- a large one for beer, soda or mineral water, 
              a small wine glass and a stemmed shot glass -- are at each place 
              setting. The shot glass is the one used for toasting."
China,Corporate Culture,"It is not necessary to always drain your glass after a ganbei 
              (bottoms up), although a host should encourage it."
China,Corporate Culture,"Do not drink until you toast others at the table. Chinese 
              consider drinking alone to be rude. Simply raising your glass and 
              making eye contact is sufficient. If you are toasted, sip your 
              drink in reply."
China,Corporate Culture,"A toast to friendship among companies will help cement a 
              business relationship."
China,Corporate Culture,"Unless you are totally drunk, it is not advised to refuse a 
              drink. Sipping your drink is perfectly acceptable."
China,Corporate Culture,"Leave some food on your plate during each course of a meal to 
              honor the generosity of your host. It is bad manners for a Chinese 
              host not to keep refilling guests' plates or teacups."
China,Corporate Culture,"Seating is very important. The guest of honor is always placed 
              at the head of the room, facing the door. Allow the host to begin 
              eating before joining in."
China,Corporate Culture,"Do not discuss business at dinner unless your Chinese 
              counterpart initiates it."
China,Corporate Culture,"Slurping soup and belching are acceptable. Cover your mouth 
              with your hand when using a toothpick. Put bones, seeds, etc. on 
              the table, never in your rice bowl."
China,Corporate Culture,"Chopsticks are used for all meals. Tapping your chopsticks on 
              the table is considered very rude."
China,Corporate Culture,"When finished eating, place your chopsticks neatly on the 
              table or on the chopstick rest."
China,Corporate Culture,"When hosting, order one dish for every person present and one 
              extra. In addition, order rice, noodles and buns. Soup usually 
              comes at some point during the meal. The host should tell his/her 
              guests to begin eating a new dish before he digs in himself."
China,Corporate Culture,The host (the one who invites) pays the bill for everyone.
China,Corporate Culture,"If you are the guest of honor at a dinner, leave shortly after 
              the meal is finished, as no one will leave before the guest of 
              honor."
China,Corporate Culture,"Breakfast meetings are rare, but you may request one."
China,Corporate Culture,"Guests are rarely invited to a Chinese home. It is an honor to 
              be a guest. Be on time or a little early for an invitation, and 
              take a small gift."
China,Corporate Culture,"Bedrooms and kitchens are private. Don't enter these rooms 
              unless you are invited to do so."
China,Corporate Culture,"All dishes are served at once in a home. The host will place 
              portions of each dish on guests' plates. Sample each dish."
China,Corporate Culture,Rare beef is considered barbaric by the Chinese.
China,Corporate Culture,Dress
China,Corporate Culture,"Conservative, simple, unpretentious, modest clothing should be 
              worn -- nothing flashy or overly fashionable."
China,Corporate Culture,"Women should avoid bare backs, shorts, low-cut tops and 
              excessive jewelry."
China,Corporate Culture,"For business, men should wear sport coats and ties. Slacks and 
              open-necked shirts are generally suitable in the summer for 
              business meetings; jackets and ties are not necessary."
China,Corporate Culture,"Women should wear dresses or pantsuits for business and should 
              avoid heavy make-up and dangling, gaudy jewelry."
China,Corporate Culture,Gifts
China,Corporate Culture,"Present a gift with both hands. Gifts are generally not opened 
              upon receiving. Always give a gift to everyone present or don't 
              give gifts at all."
China,Corporate Culture,"Older Chinese usually refuse a gift at first to be polite. 
              Offer a second time."
China,Corporate Culture,"Never give a gift of great value until a clear relationship is 
              established. This would cause embarrassment and may not be 
              accepted. Never give gifts in sets (i.e., dishes), but never in 
              sets of four (a number associated with death)."
China,Corporate Culture,"Avoid white, which is symbolic of death, especially of 
              parents, and black, which symbolizes tragedy or death."
China,Corporate Culture,"When invited to someone's home, always bring a small gift for 
              the hostess, such as brandy, chocolates or cakes."
China,Corporate Culture,"Be prepared to exchange a modest gift with your business 
              colleagues at the first meeting. Not giving a gift could start a 
              business meeting off on the wrong foot."
China,Corporate Culture,"Always give gifts to each member of the Chinese delegation 
              that meets you in the order in which they were introduced. 
              Suggested gifts: cigarettes (especially Marlboro and Kent), French 
              brandy, whiskey, pens, lighters, desk attire, cognac, books, 
              framed paintings. Give more valuable gifts — like cellular phones 
              or small CD players — to senior level people."
China,Corporate Culture,"Give a group gift from your company to the host company. 
              Present this gift to the leader of the delegation."
China,Corporate Culture,Helpful Hints

              ""we'll see"" in order to save face."
China,Corporate Culture,"Always refer to China as ""China"" or ""People's Republic of 
              China,"" never as ""Red China,"" ""Communist China"" or ""Mainland 
              China."""
China,Corporate Culture,"Always refer to Taiwan as ""Taiwan"" or ""Province of Taiwan,"" 
              never ""China,"" ""Republic of China"" (the name adapted by the 
              Nationalist forces after they fled to Taiwan) or ""Free China."""
China,Corporate Culture,Do not in any way suggest that Taiwan is not part of China.
China,Corporate Culture,"Show respect for older people. Offer a seat or right of way 
              through the door to a colleague or older person as a polite 
              gesture."
China,Corporate Culture,Return applause when applauded.
China,Corporate Culture,"Refrain from being loud, boisterous or showy."
China,Corporate Culture,"Do not be insulted if the Chinese ask personal questions such 
              as ""How much money do you make?"" ""How many children do you have?"" 
              or ""Are you married?"" Just change the subject if you do not want 
              to answer."
China,Corporate Culture,"Asking about divorce would cause a Chinese person to lose 
              face."
China,Corporate Culture,"Forcing the Chinese to say ""no"" will quickly end a 
              relationship."
China,Corporate Culture,"Never say or act like you are starving and don’t ask for a 
              doggy bag."
China,Corporate Culture,"Most Chinese women don't wear wedding rings. Don't assume 
              marital status."
China,Corporate Culture,Especially for Women
China,Corporate Culture,"China is a difficult place for anyone to conduct business. A 
              woman may gain acceptance, but it will take time and will not be 
              easy."
China,Corporate Culture,"China is a male-dominated society. However, there are many 
              women in business in China and some occupy high-ranking positions 
              and important managerial jobs. One of the principles of the 
              Chinese communist system is to work toward sexual equality."
China,Corporate Culture,"Negotiating teams may have women members. Women may be used to 
              decline unpopular proposals."
China,Corporate Culture,"Businesswomen attend business dinners, but rarely bring their

              marital status."
China,Dress,Especially for Women
China,Dress,"China is a difficult place for anyone to conduct business. A 
              woman may gain acceptance, but it will take time and will not be 
              easy."
China,Dress,"China is a male-dominated society. However, there are many 
              women in business in China and some occupy high-ranking positions 
              and important managerial jobs. One of the principles of the 
              Chinese communist system is to work toward sexual equality."
China,Dress,"Negotiating teams may have women members. Women may be used to 
              decline unpopular proposals."
China,Dress,"Businesswomen attend business dinners, but rarely bring their 
              spouses."
China,Dress,"Chinese women rarely smoke or drink. However, it is acceptable 
              for Western women to do so moderately."
China,Gifts,"Present a gift with both hands. Gifts are generally not opened 
              upon receiving. Always give a gift to everyone present or don't 
              give gifts at all."
China,Gifts,"Older Chinese usually refuse a gift at first to be polite. 
              Offer a second time."
China,Gifts,"Never give a gift of great value until a clear relationship is 
              established. This would cause embarrassment and may not be 
              accepted. Never give gifts in sets (i.e., dishes), but never in 
              sets of four (a number associated with death)."
China,Gifts,"Avoid white, which is symbolic of death, especially of 
              parents, and black, which symbolizes tragedy or death."
China,Gifts,"When invited to someone's home, always bring a small gift for 
              the hostess, such as brandy, chocolates or cakes."
China,Gifts,"Be prepared to exchange a modest gift with your business 
              colleagues at the first meeting. Not giving a gift could start a 
              business meeting off on the wrong foot."
China,Gifts,"Always give gifts to each member of the Chinese delegation 
              that meets you in the order in which they were introduced. 
              Suggested gifts: cigarettes (especially Marlboro and Kent), French 
              brandy, whiskey, pens, lighters, desk attire, cognac, books, 
              framed paintings. Give more valuable gifts — like cellular phones 
              or small CD players — to senior level people."
China,Gifts,"Give a group gift from your company to the host company. 
              Present this gift to the leader of the delegation."

Colombia,The People,"Colombia has one of the most successful economies in South 
            America, despite adverse conditions and a very unequal distribution 
            of wealth. A small number of Colombians hold most of the country's 
            wealth and political power, but the middle and working classes are 
            growing in Colombia's cities. Colombians are hardworking and peace 
            loving. Politeness, proper behavior, good manners and courtesy are 
            valued. Colombians are very proud of their democracy and 
            independence. They do not like or want outside interference and want 
            to address internal challenges on their own."

Colombia,The People,"It is considered demeaning to beckon someone with your index

Colombia,The People,Corporate Culture
Colombia,The People,"Colombians are normally punctual in business, although they 
              may be up to a half-hour late. The best policy for foreign 
              businesspeople is to be punctual, but prepared to wait. Don't get 
              angry if a 12:00 p.m. appointment doesn't begin until 12:30 p.m. 
              Excuse yourself if you are late."

              later."
Colombia,The People,"Colombians want to know you personally before they do business 
              with you. You must develop a relationship with your counterparts 
              before they will consider you trustworthy."
Colombia,The People,"Always allow your Colombian counterparts to bring up the 
              subject of business. Be aware that this may take awhile. Meetings 
              may be slow, with quiet, deliberate discussions."
Colombia,The People,"Follow up a meeting by sending a letter summarizing the main 
              points and what was agreed upon."

Colombia,The People,"For business, men should wear dark suits, white shirts and 
              ties in the cities. In warmer areas, dress is less formal. Women

Colombia,The People,"Be prudent when you talk about drugs. Colombia is working with

              foreign policy is not viewed positively by many Colombians."
Colombia,The People,"If you are invited to a bullfight, do not decline. Tickets for 
              good seats are very expensive."

Colombia,The People,"United States businesswomen are received well in Colombia and 
              will be treated in a businesslike manner, although perhaps with

              business in Colombia."
Colombia,The People,"Men may flirt or make comments; simply ignore them. Women

Colombia,Body Language,Helpful Hints
Colombia,Body Language,Don't offer your opinions about local politics or religion.
Colombia,Body Language,"Be prudent when you talk about drugs. Colombia is working with 
              the United States' government in the war against drugs, but U.S. 
              foreign policy is not viewed positively by many Colombians."
Colombia,Body Language,"If you are invited to a bullfight, do not decline. Tickets for 
              good seats are very expensive."
Colombia,Body Language,"Do not be offended if you are called a “gringo.” Colombians 
              use this term to refer to people from the United States, and it is 
              not meant to be insulting."
Colombia,Body Language,"Colombians consider Panama to have been stolen from them bynorteamericanoseager to build the Panama Canal. Try to stay 
              away from this touchy subject."
Colombia,Body Language,Especially for Women
Colombia,Body Language,"A woman in the workforce is treated as any man, 
              notwithstanding special courtesy and manners."
Colombia,Body Language,"United States businesswomen are received well in Colombia and 
              will be treated in a businesslike manner, although perhaps with 
              some curiosity. North American women should not have trouble doing 
              business in Colombia."
Colombia,Body Language,"Men may flirt or make comments; simply ignore them. Women 
              should be careful not to do anything that might be considered 
              flirtatious, which may be misinterpreted."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"Colombians are normally punctual in business, although they 
              may be up to a half-hour late. The best policy for foreign 
              businesspeople is to be punctual, but prepared to wait. Don't get 
              angry if a 12:00 p.m. appointment doesn't begin until 12:30 p.m. 
              Excuse yourself if you are late."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"“In an hour or two” may mean tomorrow or next week. “Tomorrow” 
              seldom means tomorrow and may mean next week. Don't get offended 
              if someone says they will phone you tomorrow and then calls a week 
              later."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"Colombians want to know you personally before they do business 
              with you. You must develop a relationship with your counterparts 
              before they will consider you trustworthy."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"Always allow your Colombian counterparts to bring up the 
              subject of business. Be aware that this may take awhile. Meetings 
              may be slow, with quiet, deliberate discussions."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"Follow up a meeting by sending a letter summarizing the main 
              points and what was agreed upon."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"It may take several trips to complete a business transaction. 
              Colombians prefer to do business in person -- one can only get “so 
              far” by phone and fax."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"Maintain eye contact during conversations, or you may leave a 
              bad impression."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"Contracts may be long and detailed. Put the key aspects of 
              agreed-upon points in writing."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"Third-party contacts are vital to business success. You should 
              hire a local distributor, representative, salesperson and/or 
              lawyer."

Ecuador,The People,"Ecuadorians are hospitable and warmly welcoming of visitors. They 
            revere older people and honor experience and authority. Superiors, 
            parents and teachers are greatly respected. Ecuador is one of the 
            most racially divided countries of South America. Whites (Blancos) 
            are better off economically and educationally than the rest of the 
            population. Mestizos are usually middle class. Native Ecuadorians 
            (Indios) are considered lower class, and many live in poverty, are 
            illiterate and often don't speak Spanish. Blacks have overcome many 
            stereotypes."

              should be punctual for business meetings."
Ecuador,The People,"Many executives don't arrive at the office until after 10:00 
              a.m. Many businesspeople start the day by playing tennis or golf 
              at their club, then taking a Turkish bath and having breakfast

Hong Kong,The People,"Hong Kong is very sophisticated and cosmopolitan, blending the 
            cultures of Asia and Europe. Its people are highly educated, very 
            motivated and westernized. Hong Kong is 98% Chinese (Cantonese), but 
            the people view themselves as different from other Chinese. 
            Cantonese habits and customs are dominant. An individual's actions, 
            prestige, education, wealth and reputation reflect positively or 
            negatively on the entire family."
Hong Kong,The People,Meeting and Greeting
Hong Kong,The People,"Shake hands with everyone -- men, women and children -- upon 
              meeting and leaving. Note that Hong Kong Chinese handshakes may be 
              less firm than a Western handshake."
Hong Kong,The People,"Higher-ranking persons are introduced before those of lower 
              rank. An older person comes before a younger person, and a woman 
              before a man. Family members are greeted in order of age, oldest 
              first and youngest last."
Hong Kong,The People,"It is polite to inquire about a person's health or activities 
              upon greeting."

Hong Kong,The People,"Address the Chinese with Mr., Mrs., Miss or professional title 
              plus family name. Example: Lau Gan Lei would be Mr. Lau or Doctor 
              Lau or Professor Lau."
Hong Kong,The People,"Chinese names have two parts: family name and given name. The 
              family name comes first."
Hong Kong,The People,Body Language
Hong Kong,The People,"Hong Kong Chinese may stand close when talking, however, they

Hong Kong,The People,Winking at someone is considered a very rude gesture.
Hong Kong,The People,Request your bill by making a writing motion with your hand.

              appointments. Allow ""courtesy time"" (30 minutes) if someone is 
              late for an appointment with you."
Hong Kong,The People,"Tea is served at meetings. Do not drink until your host takes 
              the first sip. A host leaving tea untouched signals the end of the 
              meeting."
Hong Kong,The People,"Bring business cards printed in English on one side and 
              Chinese on the other side. Make sure that the Chinese side uses 
              ""classical"" characters, the written form of Chinese used in Hong 
              Kong, and not ""simplified"" characters, which are used in the 
              People's Republic of China. Upon introduction, present your 
              business card with both hands and with the Chinese side up."
Hong Kong,The People,"Be sure to look at a business card upon receiving it. Do not 
              write on a business card in front of the person who gave it to 
              you."
Hong Kong,The People,"Lawyers are not included in negotiations until contracts are 
              drawn up and signed."

              Send senior people with technical and commercial expertise 
              prepared to function as a team and make decisions on the spot. 
              Business deals may be sealed with a handshake alone. Be prepared 
              to compromise."
Hong Kong,The People,"Banking contacts are very important. Use a bank to set up your 
              meetings."

              personal selling are vital to success."
Hong Kong,The People,"""Yes"" may not mean agreement; it often means ""I hear you."" 
              ""No"" is generally not said. Instead, you may hear ""I will have to 
              wait,"" or ""This may be very difficult."""
Hong Kong,The People,"Do not attempt to open an office in Hong Kong without hiring 
              or consulting a ""geomancer""/""feng shui"" professional. A feng shui 
              professional advises on facility, moving date, opening date, 
              entrance, etc. and positions office furniture to be in harmony 
              with cosmic forces. Do not ignore this custom. Many Chinese will 
              not do business without feng shui approval for fear of trouble 
              from spirits. Ask a Hong Kong businessperson for the name and 
              number of a reliable feng shui professional."
Hong Kong,The People,"Make appointments for business meetings a month before 
              arrival."
Hong Kong,The People,Dining and Entertainment
Hong Kong,The People,"Tea is the customary beverage for all occasions. Your teacup 
              will be refilled continually. Leave your cup full if you are 
              finished. Chinese find adding sugar and cream to tea a very 
              strange Western habit. Place teapot lid upside down (or open if 
              attached) to signal the waiter for more tea."
Hong Kong,The People,"Toasting is an important part of a Chinese dinner. If you are 
              the guest of honor and are toasted, smile, raise your glass, make 
              eye contact, drink, raise your glass and thank the host and 
              guests."
Hong Kong,The People,"The guest of honor rises and thanks the host for everyone 
              present at the end of dinner. Make a simple, polite, short toast 
              to friendship, success and cooperation."
Hong Kong,The People,"The banquet host visits each table and makes a toast. A toast 
              is often made in the middle of a banquet when the shark fin soup 
              is served."
Hong Kong,The People,"Be sure to eat and show appreciation for shark fin soup if it 
              is offered. This delicacy is offered only to special guests, and 
              is very expensive."
Hong Kong,The People,"It is bad manners for a host not to keep a guest's plate full, 
              and it is even worse for a guest not to continue eating as long as 
              the plate is full. Always leave some food on your dish after you 
              are finished with each course. Otherwise the host will continue 
              refilling your plate or bowl."
Hong Kong,The People,"Be sure to reciprocate with a banquet of equal quality. Your 
              hotel can assist you in preparations."
Hong Kong,The People,"Rice is served as a filler. Do not eat large amounts, which 
              implies the host has not served enough food."
Hong Kong,The People,"Lay your chopsticks on your chopstick rest or neatly on the 
              table when you are finished eating. Never stick them in a bowl of 
              rice."
Hong Kong,The People,"Don't be afraid to dirty the tablecloth. Bones, shells, etc. 
              are put on the table; do not put them in your rice bowl. A plate 
              may be provided for this purpose."
Hong Kong,The People,"The Chinese find belching, slurping, clanging utensils and 
              making loud noises at the dinner table acceptable, sometimes even 
              complimentary."
Hong Kong,The People,"Oranges or other fruits are served to signal the end of the 
              meal. Leave soon after the meal ends."
Hong Kong,The People,"Never refuse an invitation to lunch or dinner. If you can't 
              make the date, suggest another date."
Hong Kong,The People,"Spouses are usually not included in business dining. Do not 
              bring a spouse unless invited to do so. If spouses are present, 
              business is generally not discussed."
Hong Kong,The People,Dress
Hong Kong,The People,"Hong Kong residents are very style-conscious and dress well. 
              Modesty and cleanliness are very important."
Hong Kong,The People,"All types of clothing are worn in Hong Kong. However, taste 
              and fashion look more toward Japan than Britain or the United 
              States. Clothing should be light for summer with sweaters and 
              jackets for winter."
Hong Kong,The People,"For business, men should wear conservative and lightweight 
              Western-style suits and ties. Women should wear conservative 
              dresses, suits or skirts and blouses."
Hong Kong,The People,Wear a good watch. It will be noticed.
Hong Kong,The People,"The Chinese tend to dress up when going out in the evening. 
              Most European-style hotel restaurants require a coat and tie in 
              the evening. Women should wear cocktail dresses or evening pants."
Hong Kong,The People,Gifts
Hong Kong,The People,"Gift giving is a tradition in Hong Kong that communicates 
              respect and friendship. Be prepared to present a small gift at the 
              first meeting, such as high-quality cognac, brandy, candy or pens. 
              Unlike other Asian countries, Scotch whiskey is not special in 
              Hong Kong."
Hong Kong,The People,Never go to a Chinese home without a gift.
Hong Kong,The People,"Present and receive a gift with both hands. Do not open a gift 
              upon receiving it."
Hong Kong,The People,"The word for the number ""3"" in Chinese sounds like the word 
              for ""life,"" and the word for the number ""8"" sounds like the word 
              for ""prosperity."" The Chinese word for number ""9"" is a homonym for 
              the word ""eternity."" Give gifts in these numbers, if possible. Do 
              not give gifts in a group of four; the Chinese word for ""4"" sounds 
              similar to the word for ""death."""
Hong Kong,The People,"Avoid giving white or red flowers (white is a symbol of 
              mourning, red is a symbol of blood); clocks are associated with 
              death, but watches are suitable gifts."
Hong Kong,The People,"Every conceivable product can be purchased in Hong Kong. Try 
              to bring something from your hometown or state."
Hong Kong,The People,It is illegal to give a civil servant a gift.
Hong Kong,The People,Helpful Hints

              saying it."" You will have to learn to read between the lines."
Hong Kong,The People,Expect Hong Kong Chinese to ask personal questions.
Hong Kong,The People,"Compliment Hong Kong Chinese, but expect a denial. Politely 
              deny a compliment to show humility. Do not say thank you."
Hong Kong,The People,Do not speak loudly.
Hong Kong,The People,"You may be referred to as ""Gweilo"" (foreign devil). While 
              perhaps insulting, it is generally not a personal attack."
Hong Kong,The People,"Hong Kong Chinese are very superstitious; mentioning failure, 
              poverty or death offends them."
Hong Kong,The People,Especially for Women
Hong Kong,The People,"Foreign businesswomen should have little trouble conducting 
              business in Hong Kong."

Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Be sure to look at a business card upon receiving it. Do not 
              write on a business card in front of the person who gave it to 
              you."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Lawyers are not included in negotiations until contracts are 
              drawn up and signed."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Negotiations may be slow and detailed, but very efficient. 
              Send senior people with technical and commercial expertise 
              prepared to function as a team and make decisions on the spot. 
              Business deals may be sealed with a handshake alone. Be prepared 
              to compromise."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Banking contacts are very important. Use a bank to set up your 
              meetings."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Take time to build relationships. It may take several meetings 
              to accomplish goals. Do business face to face. Courtesy calls and 
              personal selling are vital to success."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"""Yes"" may not mean agreement; it often means ""I hear you."" 
              ""No"" is generally not said. Instead, you may hear ""I will have to 
              wait,"" or ""This may be very difficult."""
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Do not attempt to open an office in Hong Kong without hiring 
              or consulting a ""geomancer""/""feng shui"" professional. A feng shui 
              professional advises on facility, moving date, opening date, 
              entrance, etc. and positions office furniture to be in harmony 
              with cosmic forces. Do not ignore this custom. Many Chinese will 
              not do business without feng shui approval for fear of trouble 
              from spirits. Ask a Hong Kong businessperson for the name and 
              number of a reliable feng shui professional."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Make appointments for business meetings a month before 
              arrival."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,Dining and Entertainment
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Tea is the customary beverage for all occasions. Your teacup 
              will be refilled continually. Leave your cup full if you are 
              finished. Chinese find adding sugar and cream to tea a very 
              strange Western habit. Place teapot lid upside down (or open if 
              attached) to signal the waiter for more tea."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Toasting is an important part of a Chinese dinner. If you are 
              the guest of honor and are toasted, smile, raise your glass, make 
              eye contact, drink, raise your glass and thank the host and 
              guests."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"The guest of honor rises and thanks the host for everyone 
              present at the end of dinner. Make a simple, polite, short toast 
              to friendship, success and cooperation."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"The banquet host visits each table and makes a toast. A toast 
              is often made in the middle of a banquet when the shark fin soup 
              is served."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Be sure to eat and show appreciation for shark fin soup if it 
              is offered. This delicacy is offered only to special guests, and 
              is very expensive."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"It is bad manners for a host not to keep a guest's plate full, 
              and it is even worse for a guest not to continue eating as long as 
              the plate is full. Always leave some food on your dish after you 
              are finished with each course. Otherwise the host will continue 
              refilling your plate or bowl."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Be sure to reciprocate with a banquet of equal quality. Your 
              hotel can assist you in preparations."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Rice is served as a filler. Do not eat large amounts, which 
              implies the host has not served enough food."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Lay your chopsticks on your chopstick rest or neatly on the 
              table when you are finished eating. Never stick them in a bowl of 
              rice."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Don't be afraid to dirty the tablecloth. Bones, shells, etc. 
              are put on the table; do not put them in your rice bowl. A plate 
              may be provided for this purpose."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"The Chinese find belching, slurping, clanging utensils and 
              making loud noises at the dinner table acceptable, sometimes even 
              complimentary."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Oranges or other fruits are served to signal the end of the

Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,Wear a good watch. It will be noticed.
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"The Chinese tend to dress up when going out in the evening.

Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,Gifts
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Gift giving is a tradition in Hong Kong that communicates

India,The People,"India is one of the most diverse countries in the world. It is a 
            sophisticated, modern, industrial leader that is home to many 
            primitive tribes and millions of poor people. Religion and language 
            separate people. The caste system limits social mobility (600,000 
            people belong to the lowest caste). Because of disparities in 
            distribution of wealth, a wide gap separates the few wealthy from 
            the many poor."
India,The People,Meeting and Greeting
India,The People,"Westerners may shake hands, however, greeting with 'namaste' 
              (na-mas-TAY) (placing both hands together with a slight bow) is 
              appreciated and shows respect for Indian customs."
India,The People,"Men shake hands with men when meeting or leaving. Men do not 
              touch women when meeting or greeting. Western women may offer 
              their hand to a westernized Indian man, but not normally to 
              others. Traditional Indian women may shake hands with foreign 
              women but not usually with men."
India,The People,Body Language
India,The People,Public displays of affection are not proper.
India,The People,"Indians generally allow an arm's length space between 
              themselves and others. Don't stand close to Indians. Indians value 
              personal space."
India,The People,"Indian men may engage in friendly back patting merely as a 
              sign of friendship."
India,The People,"When an Indian smiles and jerks his/her head backward -- a 
              gesture that looks somewhat like a Western ""no"" -- or moves his 
              head in a figure 8, this means ""yes."""
India,The People,"The Western side-to-side hand wave for ""hello"" is frequently 
              interpreted by Indians as ""no"" or ""go away."""

Indonesia,The People,"Along with unity and conformity to society's rules, honor and 
            respect for the individual is the basis of Indonesian culture. 
            Indonesians value loyalty to family and friends above all else. Life 
            is simple for most people; most enjoy few modern conveniences, such 
            as running water. Indonesia as a whole is viewed by its people as an 
            extended family with the president, schoolmasters and leaders of 
            business enterprises referred to as ""fathers"" by the public."
Indonesia,The People,Meeting and Greeting
Indonesia,The People,"Shake hands and give a slight nod when meeting for the first 
              time. After the first meeting, a handshake is not necessary; a 
              slight bow or nod of the head is sufficient. Shake an Indonesian 
              woman's hand only if she initiates the greeting."
Indonesia,The People,"Greet people with ""Selamat"" (sell-a-mat), which means peace. 
              Say it slowly and sincerely."
Indonesia,The People,Body Language
Indonesia,The People,"Good relationships involve a great deal of physical contact 
              and touching. But, foreigners should allow time to be accepted and 
              to develop good relationships before this is acceptable."
Indonesia,The People,"Indonesians are used to an overcrowded society; they tend to 
              ignore inadvertent invasions of space. Allowing for personal space 
              is a sign of respect."
Indonesia,The People,"A man does not touch a woman in public except to shake hands. 
              Do not display affection in public."
Indonesia,The People,"The head is where the spirit resides and is considered sacred. 
              Do not touch a person’s head."
Indonesia,The People,"Keep both feet on the floor when sitting. Do not cross your 
              legs, especially not with an ankle over the knee. Sitting with 
              good posture (rigid) and both feet on the floor is a sign of 
              respect. Don’t allow the bottom of your feet to face or point at 
              another person."
Indonesia,The People,"Looking someone straight in the eyes is considered staring. 
              Avoid prolonged eye contact, which may be viewed as a challenge

Indonesia,The People,"Point with your thumb, not your index finger. Never beckon 
              with one finger."
Indonesia,The People,"The left hand is considered unclean. Do not touch food, pass 
              or receive anything, touch anyone or point with your left hand."
Indonesia,The People,"Approval is sometimes shown with a pat on the shoulder, but 
              American-style backslapping is considered offensive."
Indonesia,The People,Corporate Culture
Indonesia,The People,"Westerners are expected to be punctual for business 
              appointments. Call if you are delayed. It is very common for 
              Indonesians to arrive late."
Indonesia,The People,"Present your business card to the receptionist immediately 
              upon arrival; otherwise, there could be long delays. Exchange 
              business cards when being introduced. Present and receive the card 
              slowly with much interest. Cards in English are acceptable."
Indonesia,The People,"Negotiations should start at the top of a corporation and then 
              move down to the operating level to discuss technical matters. 
              Later on, discussions will return once again to the top level of 
              the company."
Indonesia,The People,"It is best to conduct a first meeting with the highest ranking 
              person of a company. An introduction from a local associate or 
              bank representative is helpful."
Indonesia,The People,"Indonesians don't get right down to business. An initial 
              meeting may last 45-60 minutes without accomplishing much. After 
              this amount of time, the visitor should initiate leaving."
Indonesia,The People,"Patience is a necessity when doing business in Indonesia. 
              Business dealings are usually slow, long and frustrating. Business 
              relationships must be allowed to develop over time. Several visits 
              are generally necessary to complete a contract."
Indonesia,The People,"Indonesians love to bargain. Giving concessions too quickly 
              will be viewed as naivete."
Indonesia,The People,"Clarification and feedback are a necessity throughout 
              negotiations. Avoid disagreement and, especially, arguments with 
              Indonesians."
Indonesia,The People,"To Indonesians, insisting on a written contract is a breech of 
              trust, though many understand a Westerner’s need for such 
              documents. A contract should be viewed as a guideline rather than 
              a statement of duties and responsibilities."
Indonesia,The People,"Personal visits are important to Indonesians. They do not take 
              well to faxes, telephone calls or messages. Show up in person 
              whenever possible."
Indonesia,The People,"Indonesians want very much to please. An untruthful answer may 
              be given so as not to disappoint anyone."

              left hand and the spoon in the right. Use the fork to push food 
              onto the spoon."
Indonesia,The People,Most Indonesians are Muslim and consume no liquor or pork.
Indonesia,The People,"Indonesians are known for their hospitality. Do not reject 
              their hospitality, as it will be viewed as a personal rejection. 
              Never refuse food or drink, but never finish either completely. 
              Compliments about the food are appreciated. It is a special honor 
              to be invited to an Indonesian's home."
Indonesia,The People,"The host is always the last to sit and eat. Men are generally 
              served first. Wait to be invited to eat or drink."
Indonesia,The People,"The guest of honor or senior person begins the meal; this is a 
              distinct honor. If you are asked to begin the meal, you should 
              refuse twice and then begin."
Indonesia,The People,"Fingers are still used for eating in some places. Both hands 
              are kept above the table while eating."
Indonesia,The People,"The person who invites is expected to pay the bill in a 
              restaurant. Request the bill by making a scribbling gesture on the

              your plate with your spoon (down) crossed over the fork."

              country. A lavish dinner may be criticized; be generous and 
              hospitable, but don't overdo it."
Indonesia,The People,Dress
Indonesia,The People,"Men should wear a suit and jacket for the first business 
              meeting."

              honored."
Indonesia,The People,Gifts
Indonesia,The People,"Business gifts are generally not exchanged. A small token of 
              appreciation may be given to secretaries. Gifts to colleagues 
              should be given after most business has been concluded."
Indonesia,The People,"Receive a gift appreciatively. It is impolite to refuse a 
              gift. Gifts are not opened in the giver's presence except at a 
              ceremony, where the gift is opened in front of an assembled group."

              may ask to take your picture."
Indonesia,The People,"Civil servants are respected. Be very respectful to government 
              workers. Never treat them as though they are your servants."

              sometime in the future. Set specific dates and times for 
              arrangements."
Indonesia,The People,Do not chew gum or yawn in public.
Indonesia,The People,Especially for Women
Indonesia,The People,"Indonesia is a Muslim society and very male-oriented, but most 
              female visitors experience very few hassles with men. However, 
              blond-haired, blue-eyed women may be hassled more often than dark 
              women. It helps if you dress modestly."
Indonesia,The People,"Businesswomen may invite an Indonesian businessman and his 
              wife to dinner. Arrange payment in advance to avoid embarrassment 
              (loss of face) to your male guest."
Indonesia,The People,A woman is expected to initiate a handshake.

Indonesia,Meeting and Greeting,Especially for Women
Indonesia,Meeting and Greeting,"Indonesia is a Muslim society and very male-oriented, but most 
              female visitors experience very few hassles with men. However, 
              blond-haired, blue-eyed women may be hassled more often than dark 
              women. It helps if you dress modestly."
Indonesia,Meeting and Greeting,"Businesswomen may invite an Indonesian businessman and his 
              wife to dinner. Arrange payment in advance to avoid embarrassment 
              (loss of face) to your male guest."

Indonesia,Body Language,"Good relationships involve a great deal of physical contact 
              and touching. But, foreigners should allow time to be accepted and 
              to develop good relationships before this is acceptable."
Indonesia,Body Language,"Indonesians are used to an overcrowded society; they tend to 
              ignore inadvertent invasions of space. Allowing for personal space 
              is a sign of respect."
Indonesia,Body Language,"A man does not touch a woman in public except to shake hands. 
              Do not display affection in public."

              Do not touch a person’s head."
Indonesia,Body Language,"Keep both feet on the floor when sitting. Do not cross your 
              legs, especially not with an ankle over the knee. Sitting with 
              good posture (rigid) and both feet on the floor is a sign of 
              respect. Don’t allow the bottom of your feet to face or point at 
              another person."
Indonesia,Body Language,"Looking someone straight in the eyes is considered staring. 
              Avoid prolonged eye contact, which may be viewed as a challenge

              with one finger."

              or receive anything, touch anyone or point with your left hand."

              American-style backslapping is considered offensive."

Indonesia,Body Language,"Present your business card to the receptionist immediately 
              upon arrival; otherwise, there could be long delays. Exchange 
              business cards when being introduced. Present and receive the card 
              slowly with much interest. Cards in English are acceptable."
Indonesia,Body Language,"Negotiations should start at the top of a corporation and then 
              move down to the operating level to discuss technical matters.

              the company."
Indonesia,Body Language,"It is best to conduct a first meeting with the highest ranking 
              person of a company. An introduction from a local associate or 
              bank representative is helpful."

Indonesia,Body Language,"Patience is a necessity when doing business in Indonesia. 
              Business dealings are usually slow, long and frustrating. Business 
              relationships must be allowed to develop over time. Several visits

              trust, though many understand a Westerner’s need for such 
              documents. A contract should be viewed as a guideline rather than 
              a statement of duties and responsibilities."
Indonesia,Body Language,"Personal visits are important to Indonesians. They do not take 
              well to faxes, telephone calls or messages. Show up in person 
              whenever possible."
Indonesia,Body Language,"Indonesians want very much to please. An untruthful answer may 
              be given so as not to disappoint anyone."

Indonesia,Body Language,Most Indonesians are Muslim and consume no liquor or pork.
Indonesia,Body Language,"Indonesians are known for their hospitality. Do not reject 
              their hospitality, as it will be viewed as a personal rejection.

              are kept above the table while eating."

            importance is placed on loyalty, politeness, personal responsibility 
            and on everyone working together for the good of the larger group. 
            Education, ambition, hard work, patience and determination are held

            world."

              regarded greeting to show respect and is appreciated by the 
              Japanese. A slight bow to show courtesy is acceptable."
Japan,The People,Body Language

              over knee."

              appreciated."
Japan,The People,"Japanese may exchange business cards even before they shake 
              hands or bow. Be certain your business card clearly states your 
              rank. This will determine who your negotiating counterpart should 
              be."

              managers. Do not attempt to go over their heads to senior 
              management."
Japan,The People,"It is acceptable to use a Japanese company interpreter in the 
              first meeting. Once negotiations begin, hire your own interpreter."

              Older people have higher status than younger, men higher than 
              women and senior executives higher than junior executives."
Japan,The People,"It is very important to send a manager of the same rank to 
              meet with a Japanese colleague. Title is very important."
Japan,The People,"Work is always undertaken as a group. The workgroup is 
              strongly united with no competition; all succeed or all fail. 
              Decision-making is by consensus. Everyone on the work team must be 
              consulted before making decisions. This is a very slow process."
Japan,The People,"The first meeting may focus on establishing an atmosphere of 
              friendliness, harmony and trust. Business meetings are conducted 
              formally, so leave your humor behind. Always allow ten minutes of 
              polite conversation before beginning business meetings."
Japan,The People,"It takes several meetings to develop a contract. When the time 
              comes, be content to close a deal with a handshake. Leave the 
              signing of the written contract to later meetings."
Japan,The People,"Etiquette and harmony are very important. ""Saving face"" is a 
              key concept. Japanese are anxious to avoid unpleasantness and 
              confrontation. Try to avoid saying ""no."" Instead, say, ""This could 
              be very difficult,"" allowing colleagues to save face."
Japan,The People,"Proper introduction to business contacts is a must. The 
              introducer becomes a guarantor for the person being introduced."

Japan,The People,"Restaurant entertaining is crucial to business. A person is 
              judged by his/her behavior during and after business hours. Seldom

Japan,The People,"Drinking is a group activity. Do not say ""no"" when offered a 
              drink."
Japan,The People,"An empty glass is the equivalent of asking for another drink. 
              Keep your glass at least half full if you do not want more. If a 
              Japanese person attempts to pour more and you do not want it, put 
              your hand over your glass, or fill it with water if necessary."
Japan,The People,"An empty plate signals a desire for more food. Leave a little 
              food on your plate when you are finished eating."
Japan,The People,"When drinking with a Japanese person, fill his glass or cup 
              after he has filled yours. While he is pouring, hold your cup or 
              glass up so he can fill it easily. Never pour your own drink and 
              always pour your companion's."
Japan,The People,"Toasting is very important in Japan and many toasts are 
              offered during the course of an evening. At dinner, wait for the 
              toast before you drink. Respond to each toast with a toast."
Japan,The People,"Wait for the most important person (honored guest) to begin 
              eating. If you are the honored guest, wait until all the food is 
              on the table and everyone is ready before you eat."
Japan,The People,"When offered food, it is polite to hesitate before accepting. 
              You do not have to eat much, but it is rude not to sample each 
              dish."
Japan,The People,"It is acceptable to slurp noodles. Some Japanese believe that 
              it makes them taste better."
Japan,The People,"Do not finish your soup before eating other foods. It should 
              accompany your meal. Replace the lid of the soup bowl when 
              finished eating."
Japan,The People,Dress
Japan,The People,"Dress is modern and conservative. The Japanese dress well at

Japan,The People,Gifts
Japan,The People,"The ritual of gift giving is more important than the value of 
              the gift."
Japan,The People,"Allow your Japanese counterpart to initiate the gift giving. 
              Present a gift in a modest fashion, saying, ""This is just a small

            their economic success. Ethnic tensions exist between Malays (60%) 
            and Chinese (31%) over preferential quotas. Chinese feel these 
            policies make them second-class citizens; Malays support these 
            policies, which they feel are their only way to overcome traditional 
            dominance. The Chinese dominate the business community and live in 
            urban areas, while ethnic Malays generally inhabit rural areas."

Mexico,The People,"Mexico is a very class-conscious society where social 
            stratifications are well-defined. Upper class Mexicans will not 
            dirty their hands with tasks they find beneath them. A sense of 
            fatalism is quite strong among many Mexicans, who feel that their 
            path through life is largely preordained. Macho attitudes are 
            inculcated in Mexican males almost from birth, and machismo plays a 
            pervasive role in shaping Mexican culture."

              show signs of discomfort, which would be considered rude by your 
              Mexican counterpart."
Mexico,The People,"Mexicans often ""hold"" a gesture (a handshake, a squeeze of the 
              arm, a hug) longer than Americans and Canadians do."
Mexico,The People,"Don't stand with your hands on your hips; this signifies 
              anger. It is considered rude to stand around with your hands in 
              your pockets."
Mexico,The People,Corporate Culture
Mexico,The People,"Punctuality is expected of foreign businesspeople. Your 
              Mexican counterpart may be late or keep you waiting. Thirty 
              minutes past the scheduled meeting time is considered punctual by 
              Mexicans."
Mexico,The People,"Spanish is the language of business. You may need to hire an 
              interpreter (preferably a native speaker who understands the 
              language as it is spoken in Mexico)."
Mexico,The People,"Meet with top executives first. Top-level Mexican executives 
              may not attend subsequent meetings, which often take place with 
              middle-level management and technical people. Don't feel insulted; 
              this shows that discussions are proceeding positively."
Mexico,The People,"Negotiations move slowly. Be patient. For Mexicans, the 
              building of a personal relationship comes before the building of a 
              professional one."
Mexico,The People,"Expect approximately ten to fifteen minutes of small talk 
              before getting down to business."
Mexico,The People,"If offered something to drink (usually coffee), don't refuse. 
              This would be seen as an insult."
Mexico,The People,"Take some time for consideration before agreeing to anything. 
              Quick decisiveness is often seen as hasty."
Mexico,The People,"A promise does not mean that your request will be carried out. 
              You should always ask for written confirmation of any agreement or 
              commitment."
Mexico,The People,"Management or other important people may sometimes make 
              unreasonable or overly aggressive demands to demonstrate their 
              importance within or to their own group. Be aware of such hidden 
              agendas."
Mexico,The People,"Personalize everything. Explain how all proposals will benefit 
              a Mexican's country, community, family and, most important, the 
              Mexican personally."
Mexico,The People,"Deal-making almost never occurs over the phone (and rarely by 
              letter). Mexicans prefer to do business in person."
Mexico,The People,"Your local contact person or representative is very important 
              and should be chosen very carefully. A low-level representative 
              will be taken as an affront by status-conscious Mexicans, who will 
              assume that you are not really serious."
Mexico,The People,"The status of your hotel accommodations, the quality of your 
              clothes and watch, and whether or not you arrive in a chauffeured 
              limousine or in a taxi, etc. will be critically appraised by your 
              Mexican counterparts."
Mexico,The People,"Be persistent! Don't give up if you don't receive a response 
              to your phone calls or letters right away or if your meetings are 
              continually postponed or canceled. If you give up, your Mexican 
              counterparts might assume that you weren't serious in the first 
              place."
Mexico,The People,Dining and Entertainment
Mexico,The People,"Business entertainment is very important and it is during 
              these events that personal relationships should be developed."
Mexico,The People,Always keep both hands above the table.
Mexico,The People,"Don't leave the table immediately after you are finished 
              eating."
Mexico,The People,"Drinking to excess is frowned upon in Mexico, especially when 
              it's done by women. Customarily, only men propose toasts; foreign 
              women normally shouldn't offer toasts."
Mexico,The People,"Don’t show up on time for a social engagement -- you will be 
              the only one who does, and will most likely be waiting for a very 
              long time (possibly hours)."
Mexico,The People,"To reciprocate, invite your Mexican counterparts to dinner at 
              a nice restaurant (French or Italian are your best bets). Pay in 
              advance to avoid arguments about the bill."
Mexico,The People,"Businesspeople are often invited to visit the home of their 
              Mexican counterparts. On your first visit to a Mexican home, it is 
              best to wear business attire unless specifically told otherwise."
Mexico,The People,Dress
Mexico,The People,"Men should always wear a shirt and tie, except at casual 
              affairs. Both men and women should dress conservatively. 
              Recommended colors are navy and dark gray."
Mexico,The People,Women should always wear make-up.
Mexico,The People,Gifts
Mexico,The People,"While gift giving is not always a necessity when doing 
              business in Mexico, gifts are much appreciated. Suggested initial 
              gifts include non-personal items with your corporate logo."
Mexico,The People,"Flowers should always be given when visiting a Mexican home. 
              It's OK to have them sent beforehand, or to bring them with you. 
              If you have them sent, make sure that they arrive before you do."
Mexico,The People,Helpful Hints
Mexico,The People,"Any attempt to speak Spanish is appreciated by your Mexican 
              counterparts and is seen as a gesture of goodwill. Demonstrating 
              knowledge and appreciation of Mexican culture wins friends."
Mexico,The People,"Mexicans are very proud of their independence and have a very 
              strong sense of national identity and pride. Never compare the way 
              things are done in Mexico with the way they are done in the United 
              States."
Mexico,The People,"Deadlines are often little more than (very) general target 
              dates."
Mexico,The People,"Note differences in class and status in Mexico, for such 
              differences are important."
Mexico,The People,"Little things count. Not saying good-bye, for example, may 
              well offend and adversely affect your relationship to a much 
              greater extent than it would in the United States."
Mexico,The People,Especially for Women
Mexico,The People,"Women should prepare for some difficulty when doing business 
              in Mexico. Because some Mexican businessmen you encounter may not 
              have had many dealings with women in positions of authority, you 
              should demonstrate your competence, skill and authority."
Mexico,The People,"Talk and behavior considered sexist and inappropriate in the 
              United States may well have to be endured in Mexico."
Mexico,The People,"Mexican men, business colleagues included, will pay foreign 
              businesswomen many compliments and may even be flirtatious. 
              Graciously accept such banter -- it is usually done with the 
              utmost respect -- while firmly reminding your male Mexican 
              counterparts that you are a businesswoman."
Mexico,The People,"Foreign businesswomen should not invite Mexican businessmen to 
              dinner unless their spouses also come along. If invited out to 
              dinner or to socialize by a male Mexican colleague, a 
              businesswoman should make it clear that no opportunity for romance 
              exists. Appearances are important."
Mexico,Meeting and Greeting,Shake hands or give a slight bow when introduced.

              extends her hand first."
Mexico,Meeting and Greeting,Body Language
Mexico,Meeting and Greeting,"Mexicans generally stand close together when conversing. Don't 
              show signs of discomfort, which would be considered rude by your 
              Mexican counterpart."
Mexico,Meeting and Greeting,"Mexicans often ""hold"" a gesture (a handshake, a squeeze of the 
              arm, a hug) longer than Americans and Canadians do."
Mexico,Meeting and Greeting,"Don't stand with your hands on your hips; this signifies 
              anger. It is considered rude to stand around with your hands in 
              your pockets."
Mexico,Meeting and Greeting,Corporate Culture
Mexico,Meeting and Greeting,"Punctuality is expected of foreign businesspeople. Your 
              Mexican counterpart may be late or keep you waiting. Thirty

Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Management or other important people may sometimes make 
              unreasonable or overly aggressive demands to demonstrate their 
              importance within or to their own group. Be aware of such hidden 
              agendas."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Personalize everything. Explain how all proposals will benefit 
              a Mexican's country, community, family and, most important, the 
              Mexican personally."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Deal-making almost never occurs over the phone (and rarely by 
              letter). Mexicans prefer to do business in person."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Your local contact person or representative is very important 
              and should be chosen very carefully. A low-level representative 
              will be taken as an affront by status-conscious Mexicans, who will 
              assume that you are not really serious."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"The status of your hotel accommodations, the quality of your 
              clothes and watch, and whether or not you arrive in a chauffeured 
              limousine or in a taxi, etc. will be critically appraised by your 
              Mexican counterparts."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Be persistent! Don't give up if you don't receive a response 
              to your phone calls or letters right away or if your meetings are 
              continually postponed or canceled. If you give up, your Mexican 
              counterparts might assume that you weren't serious in the first 
              place."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,Dining and Entertainment

              eating."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Drinking to excess is frowned upon in Mexico, especially when 
              it's done by women. Customarily, only men propose toasts; foreign 
              women normally shouldn't offer toasts."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Don’t show up on time for a social engagement -- you will be 
              the only one who does, and will most likely be waiting for a very 
              long time (possibly hours)."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"To reciprocate, invite your Mexican counterparts to dinner at 
              a nice restaurant (French or Italian are your best bets). Pay in 
              advance to avoid arguments about the bill."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Businesspeople are often invited to visit the home of their 
              Mexican counterparts. On your first visit to a Mexican home, it is 
              best to wear business attire unless specifically told otherwise."

Mexico,Corporate Culture,Women should always wear make-up.

              business in Mexico, gifts are much appreciated. Suggested initial 
              gifts include non-personal items with your corporate logo."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Flowers should always be given when visiting a Mexican home. 
              It's OK to have them sent beforehand, or to bring them with you. 
              If you have them sent, make sure that they arrive before you do."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,Helpful Hints
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Any attempt to speak Spanish is appreciated by your Mexican 
              counterparts and is seen as a gesture of goodwill. Demonstrating

Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Mexicans are very proud of their independence and have a very 
              strong sense of national identity and pride. Never compare the way 
              things are done in Mexico with the way they are done in the United 
              States."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Deadlines are often little more than (very) general target 
              dates."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Note differences in class and status in Mexico, for such 
              differences are important."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Little things count. Not saying good-bye, for example, may

              greater extent than it would in the United States."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,Especially for Women
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Women should prepare for some difficulty when doing business 
              in Mexico. Because some Mexican businessmen you encounter may not 
              have had many dealings with women in positions of authority, you 
              should demonstrate your competence, skill and authority."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Talk and behavior considered sexist and inappropriate in the 
              United States may well have to be endured in Mexico."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Mexican men, business colleagues included, will pay foreign 
              businesswomen many compliments and may even be flirtatious. 
              Graciously accept such banter -- it is usually done with the 
              utmost respect -- while firmly reminding your male Mexican 
              counterparts that you are a businesswoman."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Foreign businesswomen should not invite Mexican businessmen to 
              dinner unless their spouses also come along. If invited out to 
              dinner or to socialize by a male Mexican colleague, a 
              businesswoman should make it clear that no opportunity for romance

Netherlands,The People,"The Dutch society is egalitarian and modern. The people are 
            modest, tolerant, independent, self-reliant, and entrepreneurial. 
            They value education, hard work, ambition and ability. The Dutch 
            have an aversion to the nonessential. Ostentatious behavior is to be 
            avoided. Accumulating money is fine, but spending money is 
            considered something of a vice. A high style is considered wasteful 
            and suspect. The Dutch are very proud of their cultural heritage, 
            rich history in art and music and involvement in international 
            affairs."
Netherlands,The People,Meeting and Greeting
Netherlands,The People,"Shake hands with everyone present -- men, women, and children 
              -- at business and social meetings. Shake hands again when 
              leaving. Introduce yourself if no one is present to introduce you. 
              The Dutch consider it rude not to identify yourself."
Netherlands,The People,"The Dutch will shake hands and say their last name, not 
              ""Hello."" They also answer the telephone with their last name."
Netherlands,The People,"It is considered impolite to shout a greeting. Wave if 
              greeting someone from a distance."
Netherlands,The People,Body Language
Netherlands,The People,"The Dutch are reserved and don't touch in public or display 
              anger or extreme exuberance."
Netherlands,The People,"The Dutch value privacy and seldom speak to strangers. It is 
              more likely that they will wait for you to make the first move. 
              Don't be afraid to do so."
Netherlands,The People,The Dutch expect eye contact while speaking with someone.
Netherlands,The People,"Moving your index finger around your ear means you have a 
              telephone call, not ""you're crazy."" The crazy sign is to tap the 
              center of your forehead with your index finger. This gesture is 
              very rude."
Netherlands,The People,Corporate Culture
Netherlands,The People,"The Dutch take punctuality for business meetings very 
              seriously and expect that you will do likewise; call with an 
              explanation if you are delayed."
Netherlands,The People,"Lateness, missed appointments, postponements, changing the 
              time of an appointment or a late delivery deteriorates trust and 
              can ruin relationships."
Netherlands,The People,"Exchange business cards during or after conversation. No set 
              ritual exists. Business cards in English are acceptable."
Netherlands,The People,"The Dutch are extremely adept at dealing with foreigners. They 
              are the most experienced and most successful traders in Europe."
Netherlands,The People,"The Dutch tend to get right down to business. Business 
              negotiations proceed at a rapid pace."
Netherlands,The People,"Presentations should be practical, factual and never sloppy."
Netherlands,The People,"An individual's cooperation and trust are valued over 
              performance. One-upmanship is frowned upon."
Netherlands,The People,"The Dutch tend to be direct, giving straight ""yes"" and ""no"" 
              answers."
Netherlands,The People,"The Dutch are conservative and forceful and can be stubborn 
              and tough negotiators. They are willing to innovate or experiment, 
              but with minimal risk."
Netherlands,The People,"Companies are frugal and careful with money. Business is 
              profit-oriented with the bottom line being very important. 
              However, the Dutch are not obsessed with numbers."
Netherlands,The People,"Strategy is cautious and pragmatic, usually involving 
              step-by-step plans. Preparations are made to improvise the plan, 
              if needed. Strategy is clear and communicated to all levels."
Netherlands,The People,"In many companies the decision-making process is slow and 
              ponderous, involving wide consultation. Consensus is vital. The 
              Dutch will keep talking until all parties agree."
Netherlands,The People,"Once decisions are made, implementation is fast and efficient."
Netherlands,The People,"In the Netherlands, commitments are taken seriously and are 
              honored. Do not promise anything or make an offer you are not 
              planning to deliver on."
Netherlands,The People,Dining and Entertainment
Netherlands,The People,"To beckon a waiter or waitress, raise your hand, make eye 
              contact, and sayober (waiter) or mevrouw(waitress)."
Netherlands,The People,"It is appropriate to discuss business during lunch. Business 
              breakfasts are not very common."
Netherlands,The People,"Most business entertaining is done in restaurants, but the 
              Dutch do a fair amount of entertaining at home as well."
Netherlands,The People,"The Dutch will make it clear that you are their guest if they 
              intend to pay the bill, otherwise expect to ""go Dutch"" and pay 
              your fair share. No one will be embarrassed at splitting the bill."
Netherlands,The People,"Spouses are often included in a business dinner. Ask if your 
              host expects your spouse included in a business function. Business 
              is not generally discussed if spouses are present."
Netherlands,The People,"Dutch manners are frank -- no-nonsense informality combined 
              with strict adherence to basic etiquette."
Netherlands,The People,"Food does not play the major role in hospitality that it does 
              in many other cultures. It is not considered essential for making 
              someone feel welcome. Do not expect to be served a meal unless the 
              invitation specifically mentions a meal."
Netherlands,The People,"Men should wait until all women are seated before they sit. 
              Allow the hostess to start eating and drinking before you eat."
Netherlands,The People,"Take a small quantity of food to start. A second helping will 
              be offered and it is polite to accept."
Netherlands,The People,"Keep your hands on the table at all times during a meal -- not

Paraguay,The People,"Paraguayans are traditional, conservative people who strive for 
            tranquility (tranquilidad). Paraguay has historically been 
            voluntarily isolated. In the 19th century, the government tried to 
            seal the borders in an attempt to become self-sufficient. More 
            recently, very strict government controls have isolated the people 
            from most outside information. Inflation, foreign debt and high 
            unemployment plague this young democracy. There is a large gap 
            between the rich and poor. A few elite families control nearly all 
            the resources, and economic opportunities are limited to urban 
            dwellers."

Philippines,The People,"Filipinos are casual, fun loving, sensitive and hospitable 
            people. Personal and family honor are stressed, as well as dignity 
            and pride. Education is highly valued and families make great 
            sacrifices to educate their children. Hiya (shame) is instilled in 
            Filipinos at an early age. To be shamed is the greatest form of 
            disgrace."

Philippines,The People,"Men and women shake hands with everyone present at a business 
              meeting or social occasion and when saying ""goodbye."" Handshakes

              women to extend their hand."
Philippines,The People,Body Language
Philippines,The People,"If Filipinos don't understand a question, they open their 
              mouths. Raised eyebrows signify recognition and agreement."
Philippines,The People,"Laughter may convey pleasure or embarrassment; it is commonly 
              used to relieve tension."
Philippines,The People,"""Yes"" is signified by a jerk of the head upward. ""No"" is 
              signified by a jerk of the head down. Since the Filipinos rarely 
              say no, the non-verbal sign for ""no"" is sometimes accompanied by a 
              verbal yes, which would still indicate ""no."""
Philippines,The People,"Staring is considered rude and could be misinterpreted as a 
              challenge, but Filipinos may stare or even touch foreigners,

Philippines,The People,"To beckon, extend arm, palm down, moving fingers in scratching

              associate makes business arrangements much smoother."
Philippines,The People,"Establishing a personal relationship is important to the 
              success of a business relationship. Trust and loyalty are central

              can ruin the relationship."
Philippines,The People,"Filipinos often have a ""take it or leave it"" attitude when it 
              comes to selling prices. They may also may place less stress on 
              the absolute selling price and place more emphasis on percentages,

Philippines,The People,"Casual conversation may precede business discussions during 
              meetings."
Philippines,The People,"Negotiations and business deals move slowly. A third-party 
              go-between may be a good idea to relieve tension or give

              eat and their enthusiasm wanes when they are hungry."
Philippines,The People,"Communication is indirect, truth is diplomatically presented,

              considered in all communications. All communication should be 
              courteous, regardless of its content. The Filipino attempt to 
              please may result in many unfinished projects."
Philippines,The People,"Filipinos find it difficult to say ""no,"" disagree, reject or 
              be confrontational, especially when a superior is involved. Expect

              should be ignored."
Philippines,Body Language,"A foreign woman should not pay a bill for a Filipino 
              businessman. It would embarrass him and might harm the business 
              relationship."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Filipinos are relaxed about time. Meetings and appointments 
              often begin late. Foreigners are supposed to be on time."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"A personal introduction by a mutual friend or business 
              associate makes business arrangements much smoother."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Establishing a personal relationship is important to the 
              success of a business relationship. Trust and loyalty are central 
              to developing relationships. Insincerity is easily detected and 
              can ruin the relationship."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Filipinos often have a ""take it or leave it"" attitude when it 
              comes to selling prices. They may also may place less stress on 
              the absolute selling price and place more emphasis on percentages, 
              unit cost or rounded figures."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Casual conversation may precede business discussions during 
              meetings."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Negotiations and business deals move slowly. A third-party 
              go-between may be a good idea to relieve tension or give 
              criticism. Do not allow meetings to go too long. Filipinos love to 
              eat and their enthusiasm wanes when they are hungry."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Communication is indirect, truth is diplomatically presented, 
              manner is gentle, and the perception of the recipient is 
              considered in all communications. All communication should be 
              courteous, regardless of its content. The Filipino attempt to 
              please may result in many unfinished projects."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Filipinos find it difficult to say ""no,"" disagree, reject or 
              be confrontational, especially when a superior is involved. Expect 
              an ambiguous or indirect answer -- not to deceive, but rather to 
              please and avoid confrontation."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Face-to-face meetings are preferred. Written communications 
              might not be answered. Communication by mail or telephone is 
              unreliable at best."

            family is the basis of Portuguese life. Life is simple, especially

            weekends only."

Russia,The People,"Russia has had a long history of totalitarianism, which has 
            resulted in a rather fatalistic approach to living. The desire to 
            work individually under personal initiative was suppressed by the 
            Czarist and Communist states. With the advent of perestroika 
            (restructuring), the Soviet/Communist value system has been 
            scrapped, but the pace of reform has been slow and many are finding 
            it very difficult to adapt to the Western values of individualism 
            and profit maximization. Older Russians are generally quite 
            pessimistic and don't have much faith in a better life in the 
            future. Younger urban Russians have adopted a more Western outlook 
            on life."
Russia,The People,Meeting and Greeting
Russia,The People,"Initial greetings may come across as cool. Do not expect 
              friendly smiles."
Russia,The People,"A handshake is always appropriate (but not obligatory) when 
              greeting or leaving, regardless of the relationship. Remove your 
              gloves before shaking hands. Don't shake hands over a threshold 
              (Russian folk belief holds that this action will lead to an 
              argument)."
Russia,The People,Body Language
Russia,The People,"Russians are a very demonstrative people, and public physical 
              contact is common. Hugs, backslapping, kisses on the cheeks and 
              other expansive gestures are common among friends or acquaintances 
              and between members of the same sex."
Russia,The People,Russians stand close when talking.
Russia,The People,"Putting your thumb through your index and middle fingers or 
              making the ""OK"" sign are considered very rude gestures in Russia."
Russia,The People,Corporate Culture
Russia,The People,"Russians appreciate punctuality. Business meetings generally 
              begin on time."
Russia,The People,"Under Communism there were no incentives for bureaucrats to 
              perform well or to even be pleasant toward clients; this meant 
              that the usual answer to any question was ""No."" This practice is 
              still found in Russian society today, but ""No"" is usually not the 
              final word on an issue. One has to bargain and be persistent to 
              get what he or she wants."
Russia,The People,"Business cards are handed out liberally in Russia and are 
              always exchanged at business meetings. The ceremony of presenting 
              and receiving business cards is important. Don't treat it lightly."
Russia,The People,"Representatives of the Russian company or government body are 
              usually seated on one side of a table at meetings with guests on 
              the other side."
Russia,The People,"Your company should be represented by a specialized team of 
              experts. Presentations should be thoroughly prepared, detailed, 
              factual and short on ""salesmanship."""
Russia,The People,"Russians usually negotiate technical issues very competently, 
              directly and clearly but, being newcomers to capitalism, often do 
              not fully understand Western business practices and objectives. 
              You may have to explain the reasoning behind some of your demands."
Russia,The People,"Russians find it difficult to admit mistakes, especially 
              publicly. They also find it difficult to risk offending someone by 
              making requests or assertions."
Russia,The People,"Trying to do business in Russia over the telephone is 
              generally ineffective. The Russian telecommunications system is 
              inadequate, but improving quickly. The telex is widely used."
Russia,The People,"Personal relationships play a crucial role in Russian 
              business."
Russia,The People,"Business negotiations in Russia are lengthy and may test your 
              patience. Plan to be in for the long haul."
Russia,The People,No agreement is final until a contract has been signed.
Russia,The People,Dining and Entertainment
Russia,The People,"When dining in a restaurant, arrive on time."
Russia,The People,"Russians are great hosts and love entertaining guests in their 
              homes. They will often put more food on the table than can be

Russia,The People,"Learn Russian! Learning the language is of incalculable value, 
              and is the best way to win friends for yourself, your company and 
              your country. If that simply isn't possible, try to learn at least 
              a few phrases in Russian. It doesn't have to be perfect; Russians 
              greatly appreciate any attempt by foreigners to speak their 
              language."
Russia,The People,"Never refer to a Russian as ""Comrade."""
Russia,The People,"Do not expect to find smoke-free areas anywhere. A standard

              buildings have two sections: ""smoking"" and ""chain-smoking."""
Russia,The People,Especially for Women
Russia,The People,"Women are initially regarded with skepticism and may have to 
              prove themselves. Before you visit, have a mutually respected 
              colleague send a letter introducing you. Your business cards 
              should clearly state your title and academic degree. If you 
              establish your position and ability immediately, you will 
              encounter far fewer problems."
Russia,The People,"Be feminine. Allow men to open doors, light cigarettes, etc. 
              Even if you think such customs are antiquated or silly, respect 
              the cultural background of your Russian colleagues."
Russia,The People,"Foreign businesswomen can use their femininity to their 
              advantage. For fear of not appearing a gentleman, many Russian 
              businessmen may allow foreign businesswomen to get away with some 
              things (requests for meetings, favors, etc.) that foreign 
              businessmen aren't allowed."
Russia,The People,"A woman can invite a Russian businessman to lunch and pay the

              friendly smiles."
Russia,Meeting and Greeting,"A handshake is always appropriate (but not obligatory) when 
              greeting or leaving, regardless of the relationship. Remove your 
              gloves before shaking hands. Don't shake hands over a threshold

              perform well or to even be pleasant toward clients; this meant 
              that the usual answer to any question was ""No."" This practice is 
              still found in Russian society today, but ""No"" is usually not the 
              final word on an issue. One has to bargain and be persistent to 
              get what he or she wants."
Russia,Meeting and Greeting,"Business cards are handed out liberally in Russia and are

              experts. Presentations should be thoroughly prepared, detailed,

Russia,Meeting and Greeting,"Russians usually negotiate technical issues very competently, 
              directly and clearly but, being newcomers to capitalism, often do 
              not fully understand Western business practices and objectives. 
              You may have to explain the reasoning behind some of your demands."
Russia,Meeting and Greeting,"Russians find it difficult to admit mistakes, especially

              eaten to indicate there is an abundance of food (whether there is

Singapore,The People,"Singapore is a conglomeration of Chinese (76%), Malay (15%) and 
            Indian (6%) cultures. In the past, this racial mixture has lead to 
            some conflict. However, today most Singaporeans enjoy racial harmony 
            and national unity. Each group works hard to maintain its cultural 
            traditions while building a modern, cohesive society. Singaporeans 
            of the younger generation think of themselves as Singaporean first, 
            and as Chinese, Malay or Indian second."
Singapore,The People,Meeting and Greeting
Singapore,The People,"Shake hands with everyone present at a business meeting or 
              social occasion. Shake hands again when leaving. Your handshake 
              should be firm."
Singapore,The People,"Singaporeans may bow slightly as they shake your hand. Many 
              Westerners are generally taller than Singaporeans, so it would be 
              polite to give a small bow. A slight bow for Chinese or older 
              people is polite."
Singapore,The People,Body Language
Singapore,The People,"Never touch a person's or child's head. The head is considered 
              sacred."
Singapore,The People,"The foot is considered the lowest part of the body, and is 
              thought to be unclean. The foot should never be used to point at 
              someone, and you should never show the bottom of your feet. 
              Tapping your foot or fidgeting your legs denotes feebleness and 
              lack of interest. When crossing your legs, do so only by placing 
              one knee over the other."
Singapore,The People,"Raise your hand to get someone's attention. Never signal or 
              point at a person with the forefinger. Do not pound your first on 
              an open palm; this is obscene. The forearm jerk is a rude gesture."
Singapore,The People,Corporate Culture
Singapore,The People,"Westerners are expected to be punctual for social occasions 
              and business meetings. Call if you are delayed. Tardiness is 
              viewed as a sign of disrespect."
Singapore,The People,"Business cards are exchanged upon being introduced. Exchange 
              business cards with both hands after you are introduced."
Singapore,The People,"The government finances many of the large corporations in 
              Singapore. This bureaucratic system is known for its high 
              efficiency and corruption-free business style. Western-style 
              management is evident in large firms managed by Singaporeans."
Singapore,The People,"Personal contacts are important in business. It takes several 
              years to develop business relationships. Take time to know people 
              before discussing business."
Singapore,The People,"Singaporeans tend to get right down to business in meetings. 
              Singaporeans are fast-paced and can make decisions quickly."
Singapore,The People,"You are expected to deliver reports, correspondence, packages, 
              etc. when promised."
Singapore,The People,"Always talk straight and get right to the point with 
              Singaporeans. You can be direct when dealing with issues of money."
Singapore,The People,Dining and Entertainment
Singapore,The People,"Dinner is the most common form of business entertainment, but 
              it is a time to socialize and build relationships rather than 
              discuss business. Don't be surprised if business dinners are 
              scheduled for every night of the week. Most entertainment is done 
              in restaurants."
Singapore,The People,"Food is usually put on the table with all dishes served at 
              once and to be shared by all. Drinks and appetizers are uncommon, 
              though they are available in Western restaurants."
Singapore,The People,Allow the host to order all the dishes.
Singapore,The People,"Chinese may offer a banquet. A Westerner should always 
              reciprocate with a banquet of equal value before departing."
Singapore,The People,"Chinese use chopsticks for most food and porcelain spoons for 
              the liquid part of soup. Western style utensils are used, but are 
              not as common as chopsticks."
Singapore,The People,"Allow a Chinese host to invite you to start your meal and 
              begin eating before you start to eat."
Singapore,The People,"When finished with your meal, place chopsticks on the 
              chopstick rest (setting them on your plate means you are not 
              finished)."
Singapore,The People,"Be on time for dinner in a Malay home. The dinner is usually 
              served immediately with no drinks or appetizers beforehand."
Singapore,The People,"Indians always wash their hands before and after a meal. In a 
              Malay home, you will be given a small bowl of water and a towel. 
              Use the water to wash your hands."
Singapore,The People,"Malays and Indians use a spoon along with their hands to eat, 
              but never use your left hand to eat (unclean). If given a spoon 
              and fork, hold the spoon in your right hand and use your fork 
              (left hand) to push food onto the spoon."
Singapore,The People,"Never let the serving spoon touch your plate and never share 
              your leftovers. Indians believe that anything that touches 
              someone's plate is tainted."
Singapore,The People,"It is impolite to refuse initial offers of food or drink. To 
              refuse seconds, place your hand above your plate and say, ""No, 
              thank you."" When finished, place your spoon and fork together on 
              your plate. If they are not placed together, you will be offered 
              more food."
Singapore,The People,"After a meal with Indians, expect to stay for approximately 
              one hour of conversation."
Singapore,The People,Dress
Singapore,The People,"Due to different ethnic groups and the modern character of 
              Singaporeans, there are many different attires acceptable. Dress 
              is normally very casual. Western clothing is most common."
Singapore,The People,"For business, men should wear white shirts, tie and slacks. 
              Jackets are usually not required."
Singapore,The People,"Women should wear blouses with sleeves and skirts or

              following: jaywalk; smoke in public or in air-conditioned 
              buildings (except country clubs); enter the country with drugs; 
              litter, or import, manufacture, sell or use chewing gum."

              understood or appreciated."
Singapore,The People,Especially for Women
Singapore,The People,"Western women may confront a small bias when doing business in 
              Singapore. Being taller than Singaporeans may be advantageous to 
              women."
Singapore,The People,"Singapore has an official policy against discrimination of 
              women, and Singaporean women are gaining a wider acceptance in

Singapore,Meeting and Greeting,"Shake hands with everyone present at a business meeting or 
              social occasion. Shake hands again when leaving. Your handshake 
              should be firm."
Singapore,Meeting and Greeting,"Singaporeans may bow slightly as they shake your hand. Many 
              Westerners are generally taller than Singaporeans, so it would be 
              polite to give a small bow. A slight bow for Chinese or older 
              people is polite."
Singapore,Meeting and Greeting,Body Language

              sacred."

              thought to be unclean. The foot should never be used to point at 
              someone, and you should never show the bottom of your feet. 
              Tapping your foot or fidgeting your legs denotes feebleness and 
              lack of interest. When crossing your legs, do so only by placing 
              one knee over the other."

              point at a person with the forefinger. Do not pound your first on

Singapore,Meeting and Greeting,Corporate Culture
Singapore,Meeting and Greeting,"Westerners are expected to be punctual for social occasions

              someone's plate is tainted."
Singapore,Dining and Entertainment,"It is impolite to refuse initial offers of food or drink. To 
              refuse seconds, place your hand above your plate and say, ""No, 
              thank you."" When finished, place your spoon and fork together on 
              your plate. If they are not placed together, you will be offered 
              more food."

              one hour of conversation."

South Korea,The People,"Korea is one of the most homogeneous countries in the world, 
            racially and linguistically. It has its own culture, language, dress 
            and cuisine, separate and distinct from its neighboring countries. 
            Hard work, filial piety and modesty are characteristics esteemed by 
            Koreans. They are proud of their traditional culture and their 
            modern economic success. Education is highly valued as the path to 
            status, money and success."
South Korea,The People,Meeting and Greeting
South Korea,The People,"The bow is the traditional Korean greeting, although it is 
              often accompanied by a handshake among men. To show respect when 
              shaking hands, support your right forearm with your left hand."
South Korea,The People,"Korean women usually nod slightly and will not shake hands 
              with Western men. Western women may offer their hand to a Korean 
              man."
South Korea,The People,"Bow when departing. Younger people wave (move their arm from 
              side to side)."
South Korea,The People,Names and Titles
South Korea,The People,"It is considered very impolite to address a Korean with his or 
              her given name. Address Koreans using appropriate professional 
              titles until specifically invited by your host or colleagues to 
              use their given names."
South Korea,The People,"Americans should address a Korean with Mr., Mrs., Miss + 
              family name; however, never address a high-ranking person or 
              superior in this manner."
South Korea,The People,"Korean names are the opposite of Western names with the family 
              name first, followed by the two-part given name. The first of the 
              two given names is shared by everyone of the same generation in 
              the family, and the second is the individual's given name. 
              Example: Lee (Family) + Dong (Shared Given) + Sung (Given). Dong 
              Sung is the individual's given name. Address him as Mr. Lee or Lee 
              Sonsaengnim (which means ""teacher"")."
South Korea,The People,Body Language
South Korea,The People,"Koreans consider it a personal violation to be touched by 
              someone who is not a relative or close friend. Avoid touching, 
              patting or back slapping a Korean."
South Korea,The People,"Direct eye contact between junior and senior businesspeople 
              should be avoided. This is seen as impolite or even as a 
              challenge."
South Korea,The People,"Do not cross your legs or stretch your legs out straight in 
              front of you. Keep your feet on the floor, never on a desk or 
              chair."
South Korea,The People,"Always pass and receive objects with your right hand 
              (supported by the left hand at the wrist or forearm) or with two 
              hands."
South Korea,The People,"To beckon someone, extend your arm, palm down, and move your 
              fingers in a scratching motion. Never point with your index 
              finger."
South Korea,The People,Corporate Culture
South Korea,The People,"Koreans expect Westerners to be punctual for social occasions 
              and business meetings. Call if you will be delayed. However, you 
              may be kept waiting up to a half hour. This is not a sign of 
              disrespect, but reflects the pressure of time on Korean 
              executives."
South Korea,The People,"Professionals meeting for the first time usually exchange 
              business cards. Present your card and receive your colleague's 
              card with both hands."
South Korea,The People,"Building trust and relationships is vital to establishing a 
              successful business relationship. This requires patience. Koreans 
              prefer to do business with people they know."
South Korea,The People,"The first meeting is to establish trust, so business should 
              not be discussed. Be formal in meetings until the Korean 
              delegation loosens up."
South Korea,The People,"Negotiations are generally long and require several trips. Be 
              prepared for business meetings to go well beyond business hours."
South Korea,The People,"Koreans generally start negotiations at an unreasonable 
              position and prepare to compromise. Koreans are tough negotiators 
              and admire a firm, persistent negotiator, but refrain from being 
              too aggressive."
South Korea,The People,"A low, deep bow from Koreans at the end of a meeting indicates 
              a successful meeting. A quick, short parting bow could mean 
              dissatisfaction with meetings. Send a meeting review outlining all 
              discussions and agreements to your Korean counterpart after you 
              leave Korea. Make several visits during negotiations and after 
              business is established."
South Korea,The People,"""Yes"" is not necessarily “yes.” Koreans avoid saying ""no."" Try 
              to phrase questions in a manner that doesn't require a ""yes"" or 
              ""no"" answer. Example: Instead of saying ""Could we sign the 
              agreement by next Friday?” say ""When is the earliest date that we 
              could expect to sign this agreement?"""
South Korea,The People,Dining and Entertainment
South Korea,The People,"Sharing a dinner is vital to building friendships that foster 
              trust. Your business success is directly related to your social 
              relationships."
South Korea,The People,"Do not pour your own drink, but do offer to pour others'. It 
              is common to trade and fill each other's cup. To refuse is an 
              insult. Women pour men's drinks, but never another woman's drink. 
              A woman may pour her own drink. Leave some drink in your glass if 
              you don't want a refill."
South Korea,The People,"Wherever you see a ""No Tipping"" sign, do not tip. Koreans find 
              tipping offensive, although tipping is now becoming expected in 
              Western hotels."
South Korea,The People,"Always allow your host to seat you. The seat of honor is the 
              seat looking at the front door. If you are seated in the seat of 
              honor, it is polite to protest slightly."
South Korea,The People,"Koreans do not like to talk a lot during dinner. Periods of 
              silence are common and appreciated at a dinner. The meal usually 
              comes before socializing at a dinner party."
South Korea,The People,"It is polite to pass or accept food or drink with your right 
              hand while your left hand supports your forearm/wrist."
South Korea,The People,"The person who invites pays the bill for everyone. However, it 
              is polite to offer to pay. When two people are dining, usually the 
              younger person pays for the older person."
South Korea,The People,"Prepare to sing a solo number after dinner, no matter what 
              kind of voice you have. Any song is acceptable, as long as you 
              sing with spirit."
South Korea,The People,"After dinner, the host may invite his guests to go drinking. 
              Don't refuse this invitation."
South Korea,The People,Dress
South Korea,The People,"Koreans dress well, and you should dress accordingly to show 
              respect for them. A formal suit and tie is almost always 
              appropriate. Koreans dress up for city activities, especially in 
              Seoul."
South Korea,The People,"Women dress modestly. Prepare to sit on the floor; avoid 
              straight, tight skirts."
South Korea,The People,Gifts
South Korea,The People,"Gift giving is very common in Korea. Offer and receive a gift 
              with both hands. Wrapped gifts are never opened in the presence of 
              the giver."
South Korea,The People,"Reciprocate with a gift of similar value when receiving a gift 
              from your Korean colleague. Koreans like regional United States 
              gifts and Indian/Western artifacts."
South Korea,The People,"Wrap your gift nicely. Bright colors are preferred for 
              wrapping gifts. Yellow and red or green stripes are a traditional 
              Korean wrapping paper design. Avoid wrapping gifts in dark colors 
              or red."
South Korea,The People,"Always bring a small gift for the hostess when invited to 
              someone's home. Give: small gift, candy, cakes, cookies, flowers, 
              fruit. Do not give liquor to a woman."
South Korea,The People,"It is common to exchange gifts at the first business meeting. 
              Allow the host to present his gift first."
South Korea,The People,"Give: liquor (good quality scotch), fruit, desk accessories, 
              small mementos, gifts from France or Italy (which often indicate 
              status)."
South Korea,The People,"Do not give: expensive gifts (Koreans will feel obligated to 
              reciprocate with a gift of equal value), knives or scissors (they 
              signify ""cutting off"" a relationship), green headwear, gifts with 
              red writing (denotes death) or gifts in a set of four (denotes 
              death)."
South Korea,The People,Helpful Hints
South Korea,The People,"Never use words like ""fellow,"" ""guy,"" ""this man"" or ""that 
              man."" This is considered demeaning."
South Korea,The People,"Koreans are not Chinese. They are distinct from other Asians 
              in food, language and culture."
South Korea,The People,"Expect Koreans to ask personal questions. This is viewed as 
              showing a polite interest in your life."
South Korea,The People,"Deny a compliment. Don't say ""thank you."" It is impolite and 
              shows a lack of humility."
South Korea,The People,"Never expect Koreans to admit to not knowing an answer when 
              questioned. They may give an incorrect answer or an answer they 
              think you would like to hear to make you feel good or to save 
              face."
South Korea,The People,"Don't talk about Koreans or their customs or culture within 
              earshot of a Korean, even if you are saying good things. Do not 
              talk about politics."
South Korea,The People,Especially for Women
South Korea,The People,"Foreign women may have difficulty doing business in Korea. 
              Although women are becoming more accepted in the Korean 
              businessplace, Korean men generally prefer to negotiate with men."
South Korea,The People,"Korean women seldom shake hands. A Western woman can offer her 
              hand to a Korean man, but should not to a Korean woman."
South Korea,The People,"Foreign businesswomen should always act elegant, refined and 
              very ""feminine.” Laughing and loud talking are frowned upon."
South Korea,The People,"Generally, women wait for Korean men to make the first move."
South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"The bow is the traditional Korean greeting, although it is

South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"Sharing a dinner is vital to building friendships that foster 
              trust. Your business success is directly related to your social 
              relationships."
South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"Do not pour your own drink, but do offer to pour others'. It 
              is common to trade and fill each other's cup. To refuse is an 
              insult. Women pour men's drinks, but never another woman's drink. 
              A woman may pour her own drink. Leave some drink in your glass if 
              you don't want a refill."
South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"Wherever you see a ""No Tipping"" sign, do not tip. Koreans find

South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"Always allow your host to seat you. The seat of honor is the

              honor, it is polite to protest slightly."
South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"Koreans do not like to talk a lot during dinner. Periods of

              younger person pays for the older person."
South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"Prepare to sing a solo number after dinner, no matter what

              the giver."
South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"Reciprocate with a gift of similar value when receiving a gift 
              from your Korean colleague. Koreans like regional United States 
              gifts and Indian/Western artifacts."
South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"Wrap your gift nicely. Bright colors are preferred for 
              wrapping gifts. Yellow and red or green stripes are a traditional

              or red."

South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"Expect Koreans to ask personal questions. This is viewed as 
              showing a polite interest in your life."
South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"Deny a compliment. Don't say ""thank you."" It is impolite and 
              shows a lack of humility."
South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"Never expect Koreans to admit to not knowing an answer when 
              questioned. They may give an incorrect answer or an answer they

South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"Foreign women may have difficulty doing business in Korea.

              businessplace, Korean men generally prefer to negotiate with men."

              hand to a Korean man, but should not to a Korean woman."
South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"Foreign businesswomen should always act elegant, refined and 
              very ""feminine.” Laughing and loud talking are frowned upon."
South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"Generally, women wait for Korean men to make the first move."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"It is considered very impolite to address a Korean with his or 
              her given name. Address Koreans using appropriate professional 
              titles until specifically invited by your host or colleagues to 
              use their given names."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Americans should address a Korean with Mr., Mrs., Miss + 
              family name; however, never address a high-ranking person or 
              superior in this manner."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Korean names are the opposite of Western names with the family 
              name first, followed by the two-part given name. The first of the 
              two given names is shared by everyone of the same generation in 
              the family, and the second is the individual's given name. 
              Example: Lee (Family) + Dong (Shared Given) + Sung (Given). Dong 
              Sung is the individual's given name. Address him as Mr. Lee or Lee 
              Sonsaengnim (which means ""teacher"")."
South Korea,Names and Titles,Body Language
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Koreans consider it a personal violation to be touched by 
              someone who is not a relative or close friend. Avoid touching, 
              patting or back slapping a Korean."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Direct eye contact between junior and senior businesspeople 
              should be avoided. This is seen as impolite or even as a 
              challenge."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Do not cross your legs or stretch your legs out straight in 
              front of you. Keep your feet on the floor, never on a desk or 
              chair."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Always pass and receive objects with your right hand 
              (supported by the left hand at the wrist or forearm) or with two 
              hands."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"To beckon someone, extend your arm, palm down, and move your 
              fingers in a scratching motion. Never point with your index 
              finger."
South Korea,Names and Titles,Corporate Culture
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Koreans expect Westerners to be punctual for social occasions 
              and business meetings. Call if you will be delayed. However, you 
              may be kept waiting up to a half hour. This is not a sign of 
              disrespect, but reflects the pressure of time on Korean 
              executives."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Professionals meeting for the first time usually exchange 
              business cards. Present your card and receive your colleague's 
              card with both hands."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Building trust and relationships is vital to establishing a 
              successful business relationship. This requires patience. Koreans 
              prefer to do business with people they know."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"The first meeting is to establish trust, so business should 
              not be discussed. Be formal in meetings until the Korean 
              delegation loosens up."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Negotiations are generally long and require several trips. Be 
              prepared for business meetings to go well beyond business hours."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Koreans generally start negotiations at an unreasonable 
              position and prepare to compromise. Koreans are tough negotiators 
              and admire a firm, persistent negotiator, but refrain from being 
              too aggressive."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"A low, deep bow from Koreans at the end of a meeting indicates 
              a successful meeting. A quick, short parting bow could mean 
              dissatisfaction with meetings. Send a meeting review outlining all 
              discussions and agreements to your Korean counterpart after you 
              leave Korea. Make several visits during negotiations and after 
              business is established."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"""Yes"" is not necessarily “yes.” Koreans avoid saying ""no."" Try 
              to phrase questions in a manner that doesn't require a ""yes"" or 
              ""no"" answer. Example: Instead of saying ""Could we sign the 
              agreement by next Friday?” say ""When is the earliest date that we 
              could expect to sign this agreement?"""

              questioned. They may give an incorrect answer or an answer they 
              think you would like to hear to make you feel good or to save 
              face."
South Korea,Body Language,"Don't talk about Koreans or their customs or culture within 
              earshot of a Korean, even if you are saying good things. Do not 
              talk about politics."
South Korea,Body Language,Especially for Women
South Korea,Body Language,"Foreign women may have difficulty doing business in Korea. 
              Although women are becoming more accepted in the Korean 
              businessplace, Korean men generally prefer to negotiate with men."
South Korea,Body Language,"Korean women seldom shake hands. A Western woman can offer her 
              hand to a Korean man, but should not to a Korean woman."
South Korea,Body Language,"Foreign businesswomen should always act elegant, refined and 
              very ""feminine.” Laughing and loud talking are frowned upon."
South Korea,Body Language,"Generally, women wait for Korean men to make the first move."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Koreans expect Westerners to be punctual for social occasions 
              and business meetings. Call if you will be delayed. However, you 
              may be kept waiting up to a half hour. This is not a sign of 
              disrespect, but reflects the pressure of time on Korean 
              executives."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Professionals meeting for the first time usually exchange 
              business cards. Present your card and receive your colleague's 
              card with both hands."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Building trust and relationships is vital to establishing a 
              successful business relationship. This requires patience. Koreans 
              prefer to do business with people they know."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"The first meeting is to establish trust, so business should 
              not be discussed. Be formal in meetings until the Korean 
              delegation loosens up."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Negotiations are generally long and require several trips. Be 
              prepared for business meetings to go well beyond business hours."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Koreans generally start negotiations at an unreasonable 
              position and prepare to compromise. Koreans are tough negotiators 
              and admire a firm, persistent negotiator, but refrain from being 
              too aggressive."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"A low, deep bow from Koreans at the end of a meeting indicates 
              a successful meeting. A quick, short parting bow could mean 
              dissatisfaction with meetings. Send a meeting review outlining all 
              discussions and agreements to your Korean counterpart after you 
              leave Korea. Make several visits during negotiations and after 
              business is established."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"""Yes"" is not necessarily “yes.” Koreans avoid saying ""no."" Try 
              to phrase questions in a manner that doesn't require a ""yes"" or 
              ""no"" answer. Example: Instead of saying ""Could we sign the 
              agreement by next Friday?” say ""When is the earliest date that we 
              could expect to sign this agreement?"""
South Korea,Corporate Culture,Dining and Entertainment
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Sharing a dinner is vital to building friendships that foster 
              trust. Your business success is directly related to your social 
              relationships."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Do not pour your own drink, but do offer to pour others'. It 
              is common to trade and fill each other's cup. To refuse is an 
              insult. Women pour men's drinks, but never another woman's drink. 
              A woman may pour her own drink. Leave some drink in your glass if 
              you don't want a refill."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Wherever you see a ""No Tipping"" sign, do not tip. Koreans find 
              tipping offensive, although tipping is now becoming expected in 
              Western hotels."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Always allow your host to seat you. The seat of honor is the 
              seat looking at the front door. If you are seated in the seat of 
              honor, it is polite to protest slightly."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Koreans do not like to talk a lot during dinner. Periods of 
              silence are common and appreciated at a dinner. The meal usually 
              comes before socializing at a dinner party."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"It is polite to pass or accept food or drink with your right 
              hand while your left hand supports your forearm/wrist."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"The person who invites pays the bill for everyone. However, it 
              is polite to offer to pay. When two people are dining, usually the 
              younger person pays for the older person."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Prepare to sing a solo number after dinner, no matter what 
              kind of voice you have. Any song is acceptable, as long as you 
              sing with spirit."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"After dinner, the host may invite his guests to go drinking. 
              Don't refuse this invitation."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,Dress
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Koreans dress well, and you should dress accordingly to show 
              respect for them. A formal suit and tie is almost always 
              appropriate. Koreans dress up for city activities, especially in 
              Seoul."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Women dress modestly. Prepare to sit on the floor; avoid 
              straight, tight skirts."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,Gifts
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Gift giving is very common in Korea. Offer and receive a gift 
              with both hands. Wrapped gifts are never opened in the presence of 
              the giver."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Reciprocate with a gift of similar value when receiving a gift 
              from your Korean colleague. Koreans like regional United States 
              gifts and Indian/Western artifacts."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Wrap your gift nicely. Bright colors are preferred for 
              wrapping gifts. Yellow and red or green stripes are a traditional 
              Korean wrapping paper design. Avoid wrapping gifts in dark colors 
              or red."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Always bring a small gift for the hostess when invited to 
              someone's home. Give: small gift, candy, cakes, cookies, flowers, 
              fruit. Do not give liquor to a woman."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"It is common to exchange gifts at the first business meeting. 
              Allow the host to present his gift first."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Give: liquor (good quality scotch), fruit, desk accessories, 
              small mementos, gifts from France or Italy (which often indicate 
              status)."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Do not give: expensive gifts (Koreans will feel obligated to 
              reciprocate with a gift of equal value), knives or scissors (they 
              signify ""cutting off"" a relationship), green headwear, gifts with 
              red writing (denotes death) or gifts in a set of four (denotes

            centered around the extended family, their most important economic 
            resource. They dislike loud, showy and unrefined behavior. Bringing 
            shame on anyone (""loss of face"") brings shame to the entire family."

              late is acceptable. Businesspeople might be late or even miss a 
              meeting."
Taiwan,The People,"Business cards should be printed in English on one side and 
              Chinese on the other. Make sure that the Chinese side uses 
              ""classical"" characters, the written form of Chinese used in

Taiwan,The People,"If possible, bring a team of two to four people (one senior 
              person with decision-making power) to Taiwan. This enhances the

              not push too hard or too fast in business."
Taiwan,The People,"Allow your counterparts in Taiwan to set the negotiation pace. 
              Don't set deadlines; if you do, don't disclose them. Decisions are 
              made collectively and thus are slow, particularly in the early 
              stages. Once facts are established, agreements can sometimes be 
              reached quickly."
Taiwan,The People,"People in Taiwan often state their ideas clearly and without 
              hesitation. However, they will generally not say a direct ""no.""

              understand."""
Taiwan,The People,"Friendship is valued in business. Taiwanese businesspeople 
              will want to know you personally before they do business with you.

Taiwan,The People,"Lawyers are not part of negotiations. Conflicts are expected 
              to be settled by arbitrators and not in the courts."

Taiwan,The People,Dining and Entertainment
Taiwan,The People,"Entertaining is required to be successful in business in

              your chances of success."
Taiwan,The People,"Dining in Taiwan can be elaborate and exhausting with as many 
              as twenty courses at a banquet. Business entertainment can last

Taiwan,The People,"If your Taiwan hosts drink a toast to you and pass you an 
              empty glass, it will be filled by one of the hosts. You are 
              expected to toast your hosts and drink the contents of the glass."
Taiwan,The People,"Pace your drinking. The drinking and toasting can go on for 
              hours."
Taiwan,The People,"The guest of honor samples any dish brought to the table 
              first. Be sure to taste the food immediately as everyone else will

Taiwan,The People,"The hosts will place food on the guests' plates. Each person

              food from a variety of dishes in his/her individual rice bowl."

              chopstick rest when you are finished."

              their fingers."
Taiwan,The People,"Never place bones or seeds in your rice bowl. If a plate is 
              not provided for this purpose, place them on the table."
Taiwan,The People,A belch may be considered a compliment at the end of a meal.
Taiwan,The People,"Tea is served at the end of the meal. This signals the end of

              to stay longer."

Thailand,The People,"Thais are tolerant of individualism, but find comfort and 
            security in being part of a group. Mai Pen Rai (never mind) is the 
            Thai expression which characterizes the general focus of life - ""it 
            is to enjoy."" Thais are productive and hard working while at the 
            same time happy with what they are and what they have materially. 
            They are smiling, pleasant, humble and patient people who laugh 
            easily, speak softly, are slow to anger, and never try to cause 
            anyone to lose face. Thais are very proud of their cultural heritage 
            and enjoy talking about it with visitors. Thais are proud that they 
            have never been ruled by a Western power."
Thailand,The People,Meeting and Greeting
Thailand,The People,"When being introduced or greeting someone, men say 
              Sawatdee-krap and women say Sawatdee-kah."
Thailand,The People,"Thais greet each other with a ""wai."" Foreigners are not 
              expected to initiate the wai gesture, but it is an insult not to 
              return the wai. If a wai is not offered to you, shake hands with 
              men and smile and nod to women. A Thai businessperson may shake 
              hands with a foreigner. Offer a wai only to a person of equal or 
              greater status. Subordinates should offer a wai first."
Thailand,The People,"Wai (why) - a person places the palm of his or her hands 
              together, with their fingers extended at chest level close to 
              their body and bows slightly. The higher the hands are placed, the 
              more respect is shown. Subordinates might raise their fingers as 
              high as their nose. However, the tips of their fingers should 
              never be above eye level."
Thailand,The People,"A wai can mean ""Hello,"" ""Thank you,"" ""I'm sorry,"" or 
              ""Goodbye."" A wai is not used to greet children, servants, street 
              vendors or laborers. Never return a wai to a child, waiter, clerk, 
              etc. Simply nod and smile in response."
Thailand,The People,Monks do not return a wai.
Thailand,The People,"Thais say ""Where are you going"" rather than ""Hello."" A polite 
              response is ""Just down the street."""
Thailand,The People,"Introductions are common only in a formal situation. Introduce 
              yourself by your first name. Feel free to introduce yourself or 
              ask for someone's name. When introducing your business partner to 
              an important Thai, mention your partner's name first."
Thailand,The People,"The inferior or lower-status person is always addressed first 
              in an introduction. Thus, a child is introduced before its 
              parents, a secretary is introduced before her boss."
Thailand,The People,Names and Titles
Thailand,The People,"Thais address one another by first names and titles and 
              reserve last names for very formal occasions and written 
              communications. Last names have been used in Thailand for only the 
              past fifty years and are difficult even for Thais to pronounce. 
              Two people with the same last name are almost certainly related."
Thailand,The People,"Foreigners are often addressed by their given names because it 
              is easier for Thais; it does not imply familiarity. Thais will 
              probably call you Mr. Joe or Mrs. Mary."
Thailand,The People,"Titles, rank and honor are very important. Introductions 
              require only the given name and title. Mr., Mrs., or Miss + family 
              name are appropriate for visitors to use in formal situations."
Thailand,The People,"Thai given names are preceded by Khun (Mr. Mrs. or Miss), 
              unless they carry a higher degree, such as doctor. Khun is used 
              for men and women, married or single. If you don't know a person's 
              name, address them as Khun. Example: Anuwat (Given) + 
              Wattapongsiri (Family) is Khun Anuwat."
Thailand,The People,"Correspondence: Use Dear + Khun + given name. Example: Dear 
              Khun Mary."

Thailand,The People,Corporate Culture
Thailand,The People,"Thailand has a pro-business attitude. Business decisions are 
              slow. Decisions pass through many levels before being decided 
              upon. Planning is short-term. Top management is often family. Who 
              you know is important. Powerful connections are respected."
Thailand,The People,"First meetings generally produce good humor, many smiles, 
              polite conversation and few results. The second meeting should 
              include a meal invitation. Meetings begin with small talk. 
              Discussing business before becoming acquainted is impolite. 
              Degrees, especially from prestigious universities, bring status. 
              Thais may list these on their business card. Thais respect 
              foreigners with powerful connections."
Thailand,The People,"Negotiations may be lengthy. Process takes precedence over 
              content. Slow information flow may delay discussions and 
              decisions."
Thailand,The People,"Thais prefer to work later in the evening rather than early in 
              the morning. Business is kept separate from work. Family comes 
              first before business."
Thailand,The People,"Frankness is not appreciated. Be subtle in responding with a 
              negative reply."
Thailand,The People,Body Language
Thailand,The People,"Touching between people of the same sex is more common in 
              Thailand than in many other Asian countries. However, touching 
              someone of the opposite sex is taboo. Do not show affection in 
              public."
Thailand,The People,"Never touch or pass anything over anyone's head. The head is 
              considered sacred in Thailand and must be respected."
Thailand,The People,"Never point your feet at anyone or use your feet to move

Thailand,The People,"Do not put your hands in your pockets while talking to 
              someone. Never put your arm over the back of the chair in which 
              someone is sitting."
Thailand,The People,"A smile is often used for many different emotions. It may be 
              an apology, a thank-you, a greeting, or to show embarrassment. Be 
              aware: A Thai's smiling assurance does not mean you will in fact 
              get what you want, when you want it. It simply reflects the Thai 
              appreciation of harmony and their ""never mind"" attitude."
Thailand,The People,"Don't wave your hands about as you talk, giving Thais the 
              impression that you are angry. Never pass anything with your left 
              hand. Never point with your hand and never, never with one finger."
Thailand,The People,"Do not cross your legs in the presence of the elderly or 
              monks."

              voice to attract a waiter."
Thailand,The People,"Thai food is eaten with a fork and a tablespoon rather than

              and coriander, but most are not especially aggressive. Food is

              has its own specialties."

              criticize anyone publicly."
Thailand,Meeting and Greeting,Especially for Women
Thailand,Meeting and Greeting,"Men conduct most business. However, many traditional 
              sex-barriers are disappearing. More and more women are holding 
              executive positions in the workforce."
Thailand,Meeting and Greeting,"Ladies may not enter a bot, the restricted area of a wat 
              (temple). Never touch a monk, hand him anything or sit next to or 
              higher than him. When visiting a mosque, cover your body. Wear 
              slacks, a long skirt, a long sleeved blouse with a buttoned neck, 
              and a headscarf."
Thailand,Meeting and Greeting,"Traditional Thais believe a woman can lose face if a man 
              touches her in public."
Thailand,Names and Titles,"Thais address one another by first names and titles and 
              reserve last names for very formal occasions and written 
              communications. Last names have been used in Thailand for only the 
              past fifty years and are difficult even for Thais to pronounce. 
              Two people with the same last name are almost certainly related."
Thailand,Names and Titles,"Foreigners are often addressed by their given names because it 
              is easier for Thais; it does not imply familiarity. Thais will 
              probably call you Mr. Joe or Mrs. Mary."
Thailand,Names and Titles,"Titles, rank and honor are very important. Introductions 
              require only the given name and title. Mr., Mrs., or Miss + family 
              name are appropriate for visitors to use in formal situations."
Thailand,Names and Titles,"Thai given names are preceded by Khun (Mr. Mrs. or Miss), 
              unless they carry a higher degree, such as doctor. Khun is used 
              for men and women, married or single. If you don't know a person's 
              name, address them as Khun. Example: Anuwat (Given) + 
              Wattapongsiri (Family) is Khun Anuwat."
Thailand,Names and Titles,"Correspondence: Use Dear + Khun + given name. Example: Dear 
              Khun Mary."

              Degrees, especially from prestigious universities, bring status.

            immigrants from former British colonies and other parts of U.K. 
            Welsh take great pride in their country and their heritage. The

            12% African-American, 3% Asian and about 1% Native American. Today 
            the biggest immigrant groups are from Latin countries."
United States,The People,Meeting and Greeting
United States,The People,"American greetings are generally quite informal. This is not 
              intended to show lack of respect, but rather a manifestation of 
              the American belief that everyone is equal."
United States,The People,"Although it is expected in business situations, some Americans 
              do not shake hands at social events. Instead, they may greet you 
              with a casual ""Hello"" or ""How are you?"" or even just ""Hi."" In 
              larger groups, many may not greet you at all. In social 
              situations, Americans rarely shake hands upon leaving."
United States,The People,"The only proper answers to the greetings ""How do you do?"" ""How 
              are you?"" or ""How are you doing?"" are ""Fine,"" ""Great,"" or ""Very 
              well, thank you."" This is not a request for information about your 
              well-being; it is simply a pleasantry."
United States,The People,"""See you later"" is just an expression. People say this even if 
              they never plan to see you again."
United States,The People,"When saying good-bye, Americans may say ""We'll have to get 
              together"" or ""Let's do lunch."" This is simply a friendly gesture. 
              Unless your American colleague specifies a time and date, don't 
              expect an invitation. If you want to have lunch, you should take 
              the initiative to schedule it."
United States,The People,"Stand while being introduced. Only the elderly, the ill and 
              physically unable persons remain seated while greeting or being 
              introduced."
United States,The People,"It is good to include some information about a person you are 
              introducing. Example: ""Susan Olson, I'd like you to meet John 
              Harmon. He designed the brochure we are using for this campaign."""
United States,The People,"Use professional titles when you are introducing people to 
              each other. Example: ""Judge Susan Olson, meet Dr. John Harmon."" If 
              you are introducing yourself, do not use your professional title."
United States,The People,"Handshakes are usually brief. Light handshakes are considered 
              distasteful. Use a firm grip."
United States,The People,Eye contact is important when shaking someone’s hand.
United States,The People,Body Language
United States,The People,"Keep your distance when conversing. If an American feels you 
              are standing too close, he or she may step back without even 
              thinking about it."
United States,The People,"People who like to touch really like touching, and people who 
              do not like to touch really dislike being touched. You will need 
              to watch your colleagues for clues on what they are comfortable 
              with."
United States,The People,"Americans are generally uncomfortable with same-sex touching, 
              especially between males."
United States,The People,"Holding the middle finger up by itself is considered insulting 
              and vulgar."
United States,The People,"Americans smile a great deal, even at strangers. They like to 
              have their smiles returned."
United States,The People,"Men and women will sit with legs crossed at the ankles or 
              knees, or one ankle crossed on the knee."
United States,The People,"Some Americans are known as ""back slappers"" -- they give 
              others a light slap on the back to show friendship."
United States,The People,Corporate Culture
United States,The People,"In a country that prides itself on its individualism, companies 
            are organized and structured with many different styles depending on 
            the industry, the company's history and its current leaders. In the 
            United States, business relationships are formed between companies 
            rather than between people. Americans do business where they get the 
            best deal and the best service. It is not important to develop a 
            personal relationship in order to establish a long and successful 
            business relationship."
United States,The People,"Americans view the business card as a source of future 
              information and tend to exchange cards casually. There is no set 
              ritual for exchanging business cards."
United States,The People,"Americans prefer directness in communication. When Americans 
              say ""yes"" or ""no,"" they mean precisely that. ""Maybe"" really does 
              mean ""it might happen""; it does not mean ""no."""
United States,The People,"It is always proper to ask questions if you do not understand 
              something. Americans ask questions -- lots of them. They are not 
              ashamed to admit what they do know. Americans will assume you 
              understand something if you do not tell them otherwise."
United States,The People,"Americans are often uncomfortable with silence. Silence is 
              avoided in social or business meetings."
United States,The People,"It is rude to interrupt someone who is talking. Say, ""Excuse 
              me"" during a pause and wait to be recognized. Interruptions, 
              however, are common. Do not be surprised if someone finishes your 
              sentence if you hesitate when you are speaking."
United States,The People,"Americans put a great deal of value on the written word. 
              American law almost always requires contracts to be written out. 
              Verbal contracts are rarely legally binding. Make sure you read 
              the fine print."
United States,The People,"Do not enter into any contract without hiring a lawyer. No 
              savvy American businessperson would dream of signing a contract 
              before consulting a lawyer."
United States,The People,"It is very important in written communication to spell names 
              correctly and have correct titles. If you are unsure of these, 
              call the person's assistant to get the correct spelling and title."
United States,The People,"Keep appointments once they are made. You may not get a second 
              chance if you do not."
United States,The People,"When you are doing business in the United States, you must be 
              on time. Americans view someone being late as rude, showing a lack 
              of respect and having sloppy, undisciplined personal habits."
United States,The People,"Being ""on time"" in business situations generally means being 
              about five minutes early. Five minutes late is acceptable with a 
              brief apology. Ten to fifteen minutes late requires a phone call 
              to warn of the delay and to apologize."
United States,The People,"It is very important to meet deadlines. If you tell someone 
              that you will have a report to them by a certain date, or that you 
              will fax something to them immediately, they will take you at your 
              word. People who miss deadlines are viewed as irresponsible and 
              undependable."
United States,The People,"Meetings are generally informal and relaxed in manner, but 
              serious in content. Often an agenda will be distributed before a 
              meeting, so the participants will be prepared to discuss certain 
              topics. A successful meeting is short and to the point. Be 
              prepared to begin business immediately, with little or no prior 
              small talk."
United States,The People,"Participation is expected in meetings. A quiet person may be 
              viewed as not prepared or as having nothing important to 
              contribute."
United States,The People,"Meetings often end with a summary and an action plan for the 
              participants to execute. A meeting is only considered successful 
              if something concrete is decided."
United States,The People,"Americans appreciate and are impressed by numbers. Using 
              statistics to support your opinions will help you be persuasive."
United States,The People,"Generally, there is one negotiation leader who has the 
              authority to make decisions. Team negotiations are rare. Americans 
              may begin negotiations with unacceptable conditions or demands. 
              They are usually taking a starting position that gives them room 
              to bargain."
United States,The People,"The goal of most negotiations in the United States is to 
              arrive at a signed contract. Long-term relationships and benefits 
              may not be the main objective. The immediate deal may be the only 
              important issue."
United States,The People,"Negotiations may seem rushed to you. Remember that ""time is 
              money"" to Americans and that they may not think that building a 
              relationship with potential business partners is necessary."
United States,The People,"Americans are very comfortable picking up the telephone and 
              immediately conducting business with someone they have never met 
              and perhaps never will meet."
United States,The People,Dining and Entertainment
United States,The People,"Americans conduct business over breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
              Some socializing may start off the meal, but often the 
              conversation will revolve around business."
United States,The People,"In a business setting the person extending the invitation to a 
              meal pays for it."
United States,The People,"The fork is held in the left hand, tines facing down. The 
              knife is held in the right hand. After cutting the food, the knife 
              is laid down and the fork is switched to the right hand to eat the 
              cut food. Continental style (where the fork stays in the left hand 
              to eat the cut food) is perfectly acceptable."
United States,The People,"The guest of honor is often toasted and should reciprocate by 
              giving a toast of thanks."
United States,The People,"Your napkin should be placed on your lap shortly after you are 
              seated and kept on your lap at all times during the meal. Do not 
              tuck your napkin under your chin."
United States,The People,"Raise your hand or index finger and make eye contact to signal 
              a server."
United States,The People,Dinner at an American home may be fairly informal.
United States,The People,"Do not be late for a dinner party. Arrive within 5 to 15 
              minutes after the time on the invitation. Never arrive before the 
              time you were invited. If you are going to be more than 15 minutes 
              late, phone your hosts and apologize."
United States,The People,"Never begin eating until everyone is served and your hosts 
              have begun. Offer food or drink to others before helping yourself. 
              Serve all women at the table first."
United States,The People,"If offered a second helping of food, feel free to take what 
              you like. Americans like people to eat a lot."
United States,The People,"When you are invited to an event, it is very important to call 
              or drop a note letting the host know if you will attend. That 
              said, Americans are notorious for not responding to invitations."
United States,The People,"Do not be afraid of hurting someone's feelings by responding 
              ""no"" to an invitation. People will be offended if you say you will 
              attend and then do not come."
United States,The People,"If an invitation reads ""6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.,"" leave very 
              close to the ending time stated."
United States,The People,"Americans tend to eat more quickly than people from other 
              countries. Dining in the United States is seldom the long, 
              lingering event it is in much of the world. The point is more 
              often to eat rather than socialize and savor the meal."
United States,The People,Dress
United States,The People,"The appropriate clothing for business varies widely. Proper dress 
            depends on the region of the country, a person's company, his or her 
            position within it and the industry in which he or she works. The 
            best approach is to be conservative until you have had a chance to 
            observe what others wear in an office. You can always get more 
            casual after you get a sense of how people dress. You cannot lose, 
            however, if you begin with a very professional attire and manner."
United States,The People,"Men: socks should match your suit. No leg should show between 
              pant hem and shoe. Remove your hat when indoors."
United States,The People,"Women: do not overdress for daytime or wear flashy or noisy 
              jewelry. American women do not wear a lot of makeup to the office. 
              Low-cut blouses, short skirts and tight clothing are not 
              appropriate office attire."
United States,The People,Gifts
United States,The People,"Americans do not have as many customs and taboos concerning 
              gifts as many other cultures have."
United States,The People,"Gifts from your country will always be appreciated. Good 
              choices are local and regional arts and crafts, books, candies, 
              specialty foods and wine or spirits (if you are certain that the 
              recipient drinks)."
United States,The People,"If you are invited to someone's home for dinner or a party, 
              bring flowers, a potted plant, a fruit basket, candy, wine, a book 
              or a small household gift."
United States,The People,"Many companies have policies that discourage their employees 
              from giving or receiving gifts. Most government employees are not 
              allowed to accept gifts. Do not be offended if someone cannot 
              accept a gift."
United States,The People,Cash gifts are never appropriate.
United States,The People,Helpful Hints
United States,The People,"It is considered rude to stare, ask questions or otherwise 
              bring attention to someone's disability."
United States,The People,"Smoking is very unpopular in the United States. Restaurants 
              have separate smoking and nonsmoking sections. Public and private 
              buildings may ban smoking except in designated areas. Some people 
              do not allow smoking in their homes and will ask you to go outside 
              if you want to have a cigarette. Never smoke anywhere without 
              asking permission from everyone present."
United States,The People,"Names are not held as sacred in the United States. Someone may 
              mispronounce your name and laugh a bit as they do it. Or someone 
              may just call you by your given name if your family name is too 
              difficult to pronounce."
United States,The People,"There are several common names and nicknames that are used by 
              both men and women. Call the person's assistant to ask if you are 
              unsure of his or her gender."
United States,The People,"""Please"" and ""thank you"" are very important in the United 
              States. Say ""please"" and ""thank you"" to everyone for even the 
              smallest kindness. Americans say them regardless of rank or how 
              much they are paying for something, and they expect others to do 
              the same."
United States,The People,"Say ""Pardon me"" or ""Excuse me"" if you touch someone or even 
              get close to someone. Americans also say this if they sneeze or 
              cough or do not understand something someone has said."
United States,The People,"Americans often share things in casual conversation, even with 
              strangers, that may seem shockingly private."
United States,The People,"Social conversation in the United States is light. There is a 
              standard format for small talk. People ask brief questions and 
              expect brief answers. Americans become uncomfortable when one 
              person talks for any length of time in a social situation."
United States,The People,"If you feel uncomfortable with a question asked of you, simply 
              smile and say, ""In my country, that would be a strange question."""
United States,The People,American Women
United States,The People,"Women are leaders in all aspects of American life from 
              business to education to government. Never assume that a working 
              woman is in a subordinate position."
United States,The People,"American women are independent. They will not appreciate any 
              ""special help"" offered because of their gender. Do not assume that 
              a woman needs more time or more help than a man doing the same 
              job."
United States,The People,"American women pride themselves on the number of 
              responsibilities they take on. Do not assume that a working woman 
              is no longer the primary caretaker of her family and children."
United States,The People,"When addressing a woman, use the title ""Ms."" unless you know 
              that she prefers ""Mrs."" or ""Miss."""
United States,The People,"Many women keep their maiden names after marriage. Some use 
              both their maiden and married names."
United States,The People,"When going to dinner or lunch, the person who invites pays, 
              whether it is a man or a woman."
United States,The People,"Do not touch a woman in a business setting except to shake her 
              hand. Hugging and kissing, even of people you know very well, is 
              best left for social occasions."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"American greetings are generally quite informal. This is not 
              intended to show lack of respect, but rather a manifestation of 
              the American belief that everyone is equal."

              on time. Americans view someone being late as rude, showing a lack 
              of respect and having sloppy, undisciplined personal habits."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Being ""on time"" in business situations generally means being 
              about five minutes early. Five minutes late is acceptable with a 
              brief apology. Ten to fifteen minutes late requires a phone call 
              to warn of the delay and to apologize."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"It is very important to meet deadlines. If you tell someone 
              that you will have a report to them by a certain date, or that you 
              will fax something to them immediately, they will take you at your 
              word. People who miss deadlines are viewed as irresponsible and 
              undependable."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Meetings are generally informal and relaxed in manner, but 
              serious in content. Often an agenda will be distributed before a 
              meeting, so the participants will be prepared to discuss certain 
              topics. A successful meeting is short and to the point. Be 
              prepared to begin business immediately, with little or no prior 
              small talk."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Participation is expected in meetings. A quiet person may be 
              viewed as not prepared or as having nothing important to 
              contribute."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Meetings often end with a summary and an action plan for the 
              participants to execute. A meeting is only considered successful 
              if something concrete is decided."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Americans appreciate and are impressed by numbers. Using 
              statistics to support your opinions will help you be persuasive."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Generally, there is one negotiation leader who has the 
              authority to make decisions. Team negotiations are rare. Americans 
              may begin negotiations with unacceptable conditions or demands. 
              They are usually taking a starting position that gives them room 
              to bargain."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"The goal of most negotiations in the United States is to 
              arrive at a signed contract. Long-term relationships and benefits 
              may not be the main objective. The immediate deal may be the only 
              important issue."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Negotiations may seem rushed to you. Remember that ""time is 
              money"" to Americans and that they may not think that building a 
              relationship with potential business partners is necessary."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Americans are very comfortable picking up the telephone and 
              immediately conducting business with someone they have never met 
              and perhaps never will meet."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,Dining and Entertainment
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Americans conduct business over breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
              Some socializing may start off the meal, but often the 
              conversation will revolve around business."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"In a business setting the person extending the invitation to a 
              meal pays for it."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"The fork is held in the left hand, tines facing down. The 
              knife is held in the right hand. After cutting the food, the knife 
              is laid down and the fork is switched to the right hand to eat the 
              cut food. Continental style (where the fork stays in the left hand 
              to eat the cut food) is perfectly acceptable."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"The guest of honor is often toasted and should reciprocate by 
              giving a toast of thanks."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Your napkin should be placed on your lap shortly after you are 
              seated and kept on your lap at all times during the meal. Do not 
              tuck your napkin under your chin."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Raise your hand or index finger and make eye contact to signal 
              a server."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,Dinner at an American home may be fairly informal.
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Do not be late for a dinner party. Arrive within 5 to 15 
              minutes after the time on the invitation. Never arrive before the 
              time you were invited. If you are going to be more than 15 minutes 
              late, phone your hosts and apologize."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Never begin eating until everyone is served and your hosts 
              have begun. Offer food or drink to others before helping yourself. 
              Serve all women at the table first."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"If offered a second helping of food, feel free to take what 
              you like. Americans like people to eat a lot."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"When you are invited to an event, it is very important to call 
              or drop a note letting the host know if you will attend. That 
              said, Americans are notorious for not responding to invitations."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Do not be afraid of hurting someone's feelings by responding 
              ""no"" to an invitation. People will be offended if you say you will 
              attend and then do not come."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"If an invitation reads ""6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.,"" leave very 
              close to the ending time stated."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Americans tend to eat more quickly than people from other 
              countries. Dining in the United States is seldom the long, 
              lingering event it is in much of the world. The point is more 
              often to eat rather than socialize and savor the meal."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,Dress
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"The appropriate clothing for business varies widely. Proper dress 
            depends on the region of the country, a person's company, his or her 
            position within it and the industry in which he or she works. The 
            best approach is to be conservative until you have had a chance to 
            observe what others wear in an office. You can always get more 
            casual after you get a sense of how people dress. You cannot lose, 
            however, if you begin with a very professional attire and manner."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Men: socks should match your suit. No leg should show between 
              pant hem and shoe. Remove your hat when indoors."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Women: do not overdress for daytime or wear flashy or noisy 
              jewelry. American women do not wear a lot of makeup to the office. 
              Low-cut blouses, short skirts and tight clothing are not 
              appropriate office attire."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,Gifts
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Americans do not have as many customs and taboos concerning 
              gifts as many other cultures have."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Gifts from your country will always be appreciated. Good 
              choices are local and regional arts and crafts, books, candies, 
              specialty foods and wine or spirits (if you are certain that the 
              recipient drinks)."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"If you are invited to someone's home for dinner or a party, 
              bring flowers, a potted plant, a fruit basket, candy, wine, a book 
              or a small household gift."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Many companies have policies that discourage their employees 
              from giving or receiving gifts. Most government employees are not 
              allowed to accept gifts. Do not be offended if someone cannot 
              accept a gift."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,Cash gifts are never appropriate.
United States,Meeting and Greeting,Helpful Hints
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"It is considered rude to stare, ask questions or otherwise 
              bring attention to someone's disability."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Smoking is very unpopular in the United States. Restaurants 
              have separate smoking and nonsmoking sections. Public and private 
              buildings may ban smoking except in designated areas. Some people 
              do not allow smoking in their homes and will ask you to go outside 
              if you want to have a cigarette. Never smoke anywhere without 
              asking permission from everyone present."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Names are not held as sacred in the United States. Someone may 
              mispronounce your name and laugh a bit as they do it. Or someone 
              may just call you by your given name if your family name is too 
              difficult to pronounce."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"There are several common names and nicknames that are used by 
              both men and women. Call the person's assistant to ask if you are 
              unsure of his or her gender."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"""Please"" and ""thank you"" are very important in the United 
              States. Say ""please"" and ""thank you"" to everyone for even the 
              smallest kindness. Americans say them regardless of rank or how 
              much they are paying for something, and they expect others to do 
              the same."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Say ""Pardon me"" or ""Excuse me"" if you touch someone or even 
              get close to someone. Americans also say this if they sneeze or 
              cough or do not understand something someone has said."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Americans often share things in casual conversation, even with 
              strangers, that may seem shockingly private."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Social conversation in the United States is light. There is a 
              standard format for small talk. People ask brief questions and 
              expect brief answers. Americans become uncomfortable when one 
              person talks for any length of time in a social situation."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"If you feel uncomfortable with a question asked of you, simply 
              smile and say, ""In my country, that would be a strange question."""
United States,Meeting and Greeting,American Women
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Women are leaders in all aspects of American life from 
              business to education to government. Never assume that a working 
              woman is in a subordinate position."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"American women are independent. They will not appreciate any 
              ""special help"" offered because of their gender. Do not assume that 
              a woman needs more time or more help than a man doing the same 
              job."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"American women pride themselves on the number of 
              responsibilities they take on. Do not assume that a working woman 
              is no longer the primary caretaker of her family and children."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"When addressing a woman, use the title ""Ms."" unless you know 
              that she prefers ""Mrs."" or ""Miss."""
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Many women keep their maiden names after marriage. Some use 
              both their maiden and married names."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"When going to dinner or lunch, the person who invites pays, 
              whether it is a man or a woman."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Do not touch a woman in a business setting except to shake her 
              hand. Hugging and kissing, even of people you know very well, is 
              best left for social occasions."
United States,Body Language,"Keep your distance when conversing. If an American feels you 
              are standing too close, he or she may step back without even 
              thinking about it."
United States,Body Language,"People who like to touch really like touching, and people who 
              do not like to touch really dislike being touched. You will need 
              to watch your colleagues for clues on what they are comfortable 
              with."
United States,Body Language,"Americans are generally uncomfortable with same-sex touching, 
              especially between males."
United States,Body Language,"Holding the middle finger up by itself is considered insulting 
              and vulgar."
United States,Body Language,"Americans smile a great deal, even at strangers. They like to 
              have their smiles returned."
United States,Body Language,"Men and women will sit with legs crossed at the ankles or 
              knees, or one ankle crossed on the knee."
United States,Body Language,"Some Americans are known as ""back slappers"" -- they give 
              others a light slap on the back to show friendship."
United States,Body Language,Corporate Culture
United States,Body Language,"In a country that prides itself on its individualism, companies 
            are organized and structured with many different styles depending on 
            the industry, the company's history and its current leaders. In the 
            United States, business relationships are formed between companies 
            rather than between people. Americans do business where they get the 
            best deal and the best service. It is not important to develop a 
            personal relationship in order to establish a long and successful 
            business relationship."
United States,Body Language,"Americans view the business card as a source of future 
              information and tend to exchange cards casually. There is no set 
              ritual for exchanging business cards."
United States,Body Language,"Americans prefer directness in communication. When Americans 
              say ""yes"" or ""no,"" they mean precisely that. ""Maybe"" really does 
              mean ""it might happen""; it does not mean ""no."""
United States,Body Language,"It is always proper to ask questions if you do not understand 
              something. Americans ask questions -- lots of them. They are not 
              ashamed to admit what they do know. Americans will assume you 
              understand something if you do not tell them otherwise."
United States,Body Language,"Americans are often uncomfortable with silence. Silence is 
              avoided in social or business meetings."
United States,Body Language,"It is rude to interrupt someone who is talking. Say, ""Excuse 
              me"" during a pause and wait to be recognized. Interruptions, 
              however, are common. Do not be surprised if someone finishes your 
              sentence if you hesitate when you are speaking."
United States,Body Language,"Americans put a great deal of value on the written word. 
              American law almost always requires contracts to be written out. 
              Verbal contracts are rarely legally binding. Make sure you read 
              the fine print."
United States,Body Language,"Do not enter into any contract without hiring a lawyer. No 
              savvy American businessperson would dream of signing a contract 
              before consulting a lawyer."
United States,Body Language,"It is very important in written communication to spell names 
              correctly and have correct titles. If you are unsure of these, 
              call the person's assistant to get the correct spelling and title."
United States,Body Language,"Keep appointments once they are made. You may not get a second 
              chance if you do not."

              unsure of his or her gender."
United States,Body Language,"""Please"" and ""thank you"" are very important in the United 
              States. Say ""please"" and ""thank you"" to everyone for even the 
              smallest kindness. Americans say them regardless of rank or how 
              much they are paying for something, and they expect others to do 
              the same."
United States,Body Language,"Say ""Pardon me"" or ""Excuse me"" if you touch someone or even 
              get close to someone. Americans also say this if they sneeze or 
              cough or do not understand something someone has said."
United States,Body Language,"Americans often share things in casual conversation, even with 
              strangers, that may seem shockingly private."
United States,Body Language,"Social conversation in the United States is light. There is a 
              standard format for small talk. People ask brief questions and 
              expect brief answers. Americans become uncomfortable when one 
              person talks for any length of time in a social situation."
United States,Body Language,"If you feel uncomfortable with a question asked of you, simply 
              smile and say, ""In my country, that would be a strange question."""
United States,Body Language,American Women
United States,Body Language,"Women are leaders in all aspects of American life from 
              business to education to government. Never assume that a working 
              woman is in a subordinate position."
United States,Body Language,"American women are independent. They will not appreciate any 
              ""special help"" offered because of their gender. Do not assume that 
              a woman needs more time or more help than a man doing the same 
              job."
United States,Body Language,"American women pride themselves on the number of 
              responsibilities they take on. Do not assume that a working woman 
              is no longer the primary caretaker of her family and children."
United States,Body Language,"When addressing a woman, use the title ""Ms."" unless you know 
              that she prefers ""Mrs."" or ""Miss."""
United States,Body Language,"Many women keep their maiden names after marriage. Some use 
              both their maiden and married names."
United States,Body Language,"When going to dinner or lunch, the person who invites pays, 
              whether it is a man or a woman."
United States,Body Language,"Do not touch a woman in a business setting except to shake her 
              hand. Hugging and kissing, even of people you know very well, is 
              best left for social occasions."
United States,Corporate Culture,"In a country that prides itself on its individualism, companies 
            are organized and structured with many different styles depending on 
            the industry, the company's history and its current leaders. In the 
            United States, business relationships are formed between companies 
            rather than between people. Americans do business where they get the 
            best deal and the best service. It is not important to develop a 
            personal relationship in order to establish a long and successful 
            business relationship."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans view the business card as a source of future 
              information and tend to exchange cards casually. There is no set 
              ritual for exchanging business cards."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans prefer directness in communication. When Americans 
              say ""yes"" or ""no,"" they mean precisely that. ""Maybe"" really does 
              mean ""it might happen""; it does not mean ""no."""
United States,Corporate Culture,"It is always proper to ask questions if you do not understand 
              something. Americans ask questions -- lots of them. They are not 
              ashamed to admit what they do know. Americans will assume you 
              understand something if you do not tell them otherwise."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans are often uncomfortable with silence. Silence is 
              avoided in social or business meetings."
United States,Corporate Culture,"It is rude to interrupt someone who is talking. Say, ""Excuse 
              me"" during a pause and wait to be recognized. Interruptions, 
              however, are common. Do not be surprised if someone finishes your 
              sentence if you hesitate when you are speaking."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans put a great deal of value on the written word. 
              American law almost always requires contracts to be written out. 
              Verbal contracts are rarely legally binding. Make sure you read 
              the fine print."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Do not enter into any contract without hiring a lawyer. No 
              savvy American businessperson would dream of signing a contract 
              before consulting a lawyer."
United States,Corporate Culture,"It is very important in written communication to spell names 
              correctly and have correct titles. If you are unsure of these, 
              call the person's assistant to get the correct spelling and title."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Keep appointments once they are made. You may not get a second 
              chance if you do not."
United States,Corporate Culture,"When you are doing business in the United States, you must be 
              on time. Americans view someone being late as rude, showing a lack 
              of respect and having sloppy, undisciplined personal habits."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Being ""on time"" in business situations generally means being 
              about five minutes early. Five minutes late is acceptable with a 
              brief apology. Ten to fifteen minutes late requires a phone call 
              to warn of the delay and to apologize."
United States,Corporate Culture,"It is very important to meet deadlines. If you tell someone 
              that you will have a report to them by a certain date, or that you 
              will fax something to them immediately, they will take you at your 
              word. People who miss deadlines are viewed as irresponsible and 
              undependable."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Meetings are generally informal and relaxed in manner, but 
              serious in content. Often an agenda will be distributed before a 
              meeting, so the participants will be prepared to discuss certain 
              topics. A successful meeting is short and to the point. Be 
              prepared to begin business immediately, with little or no prior 
              small talk."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Participation is expected in meetings. A quiet person may be 
              viewed as not prepared or as having nothing important to 
              contribute."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Meetings often end with a summary and an action plan for the 
              participants to execute. A meeting is only considered successful 
              if something concrete is decided."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans appreciate and are impressed by numbers. Using 
              statistics to support your opinions will help you be persuasive."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Generally, there is one negotiation leader who has the 
              authority to make decisions. Team negotiations are rare. Americans 
              may begin negotiations with unacceptable conditions or demands. 
              They are usually taking a starting position that gives them room 
              to bargain."
United States,Corporate Culture,"The goal of most negotiations in the United States is to 
              arrive at a signed contract. Long-term relationships and benefits 
              may not be the main objective. The immediate deal may be the only 
              important issue."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Negotiations may seem rushed to you. Remember that ""time is 
              money"" to Americans and that they may not think that building a 
              relationship with potential business partners is necessary."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans are very comfortable picking up the telephone and 
              immediately conducting business with someone they have never met 
              and perhaps never will meet."
United States,Corporate Culture,Dining and Entertainment
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans conduct business over breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
              Some socializing may start off the meal, but often the 
              conversation will revolve around business."
United States,Corporate Culture,"In a business setting the person extending the invitation to a 
              meal pays for it."
United States,Corporate Culture,"The fork is held in the left hand, tines facing down. The 
              knife is held in the right hand. After cutting the food, the knife 
              is laid down and the fork is switched to the right hand to eat the 
              cut food. Continental style (where the fork stays in the left hand 
              to eat the cut food) is perfectly acceptable."
United States,Corporate Culture,"The guest of honor is often toasted and should reciprocate by 
              giving a toast of thanks."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Your napkin should be placed on your lap shortly after you are 
              seated and kept on your lap at all times during the meal. Do not 
              tuck your napkin under your chin."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Raise your hand or index finger and make eye contact to signal 
              a server."
United States,Corporate Culture,Dinner at an American home may be fairly informal.
United States,Corporate Culture,"Do not be late for a dinner party. Arrive within 5 to 15 
              minutes after the time on the invitation. Never arrive before the 
              time you were invited. If you are going to be more than 15 minutes 
              late, phone your hosts and apologize."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Never begin eating until everyone is served and your hosts 
              have begun. Offer food or drink to others before helping yourself. 
              Serve all women at the table first."
United States,Corporate Culture,"If offered a second helping of food, feel free to take what 
              you like. Americans like people to eat a lot."
United States,Corporate Culture,"When you are invited to an event, it is very important to call 
              or drop a note letting the host know if you will attend. That 
              said, Americans are notorious for not responding to invitations."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Do not be afraid of hurting someone's feelings by responding 
              ""no"" to an invitation. People will be offended if you say you will 
              attend and then do not come."
United States,Corporate Culture,"If an invitation reads ""6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.,"" leave very 
              close to the ending time stated."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans tend to eat more quickly than people from other 
              countries. Dining in the United States is seldom the long, 
              lingering event it is in much of the world. The point is more 
              often to eat rather than socialize and savor the meal."
United States,Corporate Culture,Dress
United States,Corporate Culture,"The appropriate clothing for business varies widely. Proper dress 
            depends on the region of the country, a person's company, his or her 
            position within it and the industry in which he or she works. The 
            best approach is to be conservative until you have had a chance to 
            observe what others wear in an office. You can always get more 
            casual after you get a sense of how people dress. You cannot lose, 
            however, if you begin with a very professional attire and manner."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Men: socks should match your suit. No leg should show between 
              pant hem and shoe. Remove your hat when indoors."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Women: do not overdress for daytime or wear flashy or noisy 
              jewelry. American women do not wear a lot of makeup to the office. 
              Low-cut blouses, short skirts and tight clothing are not 
              appropriate office attire."
United States,Corporate Culture,Gifts
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans do not have as many customs and taboos concerning 
              gifts as many other cultures have."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Gifts from your country will always be appreciated. Good 
              choices are local and regional arts and crafts, books, candies, 
              specialty foods and wine or spirits (if you are certain that the 
              recipient drinks)."
United States,Corporate Culture,"If you are invited to someone's home for dinner or a party, 
              bring flowers, a potted plant, a fruit basket, candy, wine, a book 
              or a small household gift."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Many companies have policies that discourage their employees 
              from giving or receiving gifts. Most government employees are not 
              allowed to accept gifts. Do not be offended if someone cannot 
              accept a gift."
United States,Corporate Culture,Cash gifts are never appropriate.
United States,Corporate Culture,Helpful Hints
United States,Corporate Culture,"It is considered rude to stare, ask questions or otherwise 
              bring attention to someone's disability."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Smoking is very unpopular in the United States. Restaurants 
              have separate smoking and nonsmoking sections. Public and private 
              buildings may ban smoking except in designated areas. Some people 
              do not allow smoking in their homes and will ask you to go outside 
              if you want to have a cigarette. Never smoke anywhere without 
              asking permission from everyone present."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Names are not held as sacred in the United States. Someone may 
              mispronounce your name and laugh a bit as they do it. Or someone 
              may just call you by your given name if your family name is too 
              difficult to pronounce."
United States,Corporate Culture,"There are several common names and nicknames that are used by

              business to education to government. Never assume that a working 
              woman is in a subordinate position."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"American women are independent. They will not appreciate any 
              ""special help"" offered because of their gender. Do not assume that 
              a woman needs more time or more help than a man doing the same 
              job."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"American women pride themselves on the number of 
              responsibilities they take on. Do not assume that a working woman 
              is no longer the primary caretaker of her family and children."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"When addressing a woman, use the title ""Ms."" unless you know 
              that she prefers ""Mrs."" or ""Miss."""
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"Many women keep their maiden names after marriage. Some use 
              both their maiden and married names."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"When going to dinner or lunch, the person who invites pays, 
              whether it is a man or a woman."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"Do not touch a woman in a business setting except to shake her 
              hand. Hugging and kissing, even of people you know very well, is 
              best left for social occasions."
United States,Dress,"The appropriate clothing for business varies widely. Proper dress 
            depends on the region of the country, a person's company, his or her 
            position within it and the industry in which he or she works. The 
            best approach is to be conservative until you have had a chance to 
            observe what others wear in an office. You can always get more 
            casual after you get a sense of how people dress. You cannot lose, 
            however, if you begin with a very professional attire and manner."
United States,Dress,"Men: socks should match your suit. No leg should show between 
              pant hem and shoe. Remove your hat when indoors."
United States,Dress,"Women: do not overdress for daytime or wear flashy or noisy 
              jewelry. American women do not wear a lot of makeup to the office. 
              Low-cut blouses, short skirts and tight clothing are not 
              appropriate office attire."
United States,Dress,Gifts
United States,Dress,"Americans do not have as many customs and taboos concerning 
              gifts as many other cultures have."
United States,Dress,"Gifts from your country will always be appreciated. Good 
              choices are local and regional arts and crafts, books, candies, 
              specialty foods and wine or spirits (if you are certain that the 
              recipient drinks)."
United States,Dress,"If you are invited to someone's home for dinner or a party, 
              bring flowers, a potted plant, a fruit basket, candy, wine, a book 
              or a small household gift."
United States,Dress,"Many companies have policies that discourage their employees 
              from giving or receiving gifts. Most government employees are not 
              allowed to accept gifts. Do not be offended if someone cannot 
              accept a gift."
United States,Dress,Cash gifts are never appropriate.
United States,Dress,Helpful Hints
United States,Dress,"It is considered rude to stare, ask questions or otherwise 
              bring attention to someone's disability."
United States,Dress,"Smoking is very unpopular in the United States. Restaurants 
              have separate smoking and nonsmoking sections. Public and private 
              buildings may ban smoking except in designated areas. Some people 
              do not allow smoking in their homes and will ask you to go outside 
              if you want to have a cigarette. Never smoke anywhere without 
              asking permission from everyone present."
United States,Dress,"Names are not held as sacred in the United States. Someone may 
              mispronounce your name and laugh a bit as they do it. Or someone 
              may just call you by your given name if your family name is too 
              difficult to pronounce."
United States,Dress,"There are several common names and nicknames that are used by 
              both men and women. Call the person's assistant to ask if you are 
              unsure of his or her gender."
United States,Dress,"""Please"" and ""thank you"" are very important in the United 
              States. Say ""please"" and ""thank you"" to everyone for even the 
              smallest kindness. Americans say them regardless of rank or how 
              much they are paying for something, and they expect others to do 
              the same."
United States,Dress,"Say ""Pardon me"" or ""Excuse me"" if you touch someone or even 
              get close to someone. Americans also say this if they sneeze or

United States,Dress,"Americans often share things in casual conversation, even with 
              strangers, that may seem shockingly private."
United States,Dress,"Social conversation in the United States is light. There is a 
              standard format for small talk. People ask brief questions and 
              expect brief answers. Americans become uncomfortable when one 
              person talks for any length of time in a social situation."
United States,Dress,"If you feel uncomfortable with a question asked of you, simply 
              smile and say, ""In my country, that would be a strange question."""

            wealth and poverty found in most other South American countries

            materialistic approach to life. They have an inherent trust of 
            people and a strong belief in social justice. A great deal of 
            emphasis is placed on education. Uruguay has the best-educated 
            workforce on the continent. People enjoy easy access to a good 
            education, compulsory for nine years and free through post-graduate 
            studies. The literacy rate is 96%, one of the highest in South

Vietnam,The People,"A long struggle for independence has given the Vietnamese a deep 
            sense of national pride. Vietnamese value their independence and 
            history and offended by people who ignore or violate either. Most 
            Vietnamese have an interest in all things American. They believe all 
            past hostilities were part of the natural defense of their national 
            territory. Families are very strong and help each other in all 
            needs."
Vietnam,The People,Meeting and Greeting
Vietnam,The People,"The Vietnamese generally shake hands both when greeting and 
              when saying good-bye. Shake with both hands, and bow your head 
              slightly to show respect. Bow to the elderly who do not extend 
              their hand. Vietnamese women are more inclined to bow their head 
              slightly than to shake hands."
Vietnam,The People,"When greeting someone, say “xin chao” (seen chow) + given name 
              + title. The Vietnamese are delighted if a Westerner can properly 
              say “xin chao” (because Vietnamese is a tonal language, “xin chao” 
              can have six different meanings, only one of which is ""Hello"")."
Vietnam,The People,Body Language
Vietnam,The People,"Summoning someone with a curled index finger, as is done in 
              the West, is only done by the boss. To beckon someone, extend your 
              arm, palm down, and move your fingers in a scratching motion. Only 
              beckon someone who has a ""lower"" status than you."
Vietnam,The People,"Men and women do not show affection in public. However, 
              members of the same sex may hold hands while walking."
Vietnam,The People,"Always use both hands when passing an object to another 
              person."
Vietnam,The People,"Touching children on the head is only done by parents, 
              grandparents, etc."
Vietnam,The People,Corporate Culture
Vietnam,The People,"Business cards are usually exchanged when meeting for the 
              first time. Give and receive a business card with both hands."
Vietnam,The People,"The Vietnamese are generally quite punctual and expect 
              foreigners to be the same. That said, the Vietnamese can be very 
              flexible and accommodating when situations occur that are beyond 
              the control of one of the parties involved (for example, a 
              washed-out street, traffic jam, etc.)."
Vietnam,The People,"Few Vietnamese speak English well. An interpreter is usually 
              necessary."
Vietnam,The People,"A foreigner doing business in Vietnam will have to deal with 
              government officials. You may have to go through the same slow 
              procedure dozens of times to obtain the necessary permits to 
              operate a foreign-owned company in Vietnam. Continual, direct 
              contact with the ministry officials responsible for granting or 
              approving your permits and licenses is very important. 
              Difficulties may arise when one official refuses to honor an 
              agreement concluded by another official."
Vietnam,The People,"Most decisions are made by committee in Vietnam. Individual 
              connections are not as important as in many other Asian countries, 
              because no one holds absolute power to make a decision. You can 
              not rely on one person in a particular organization to safeguard 
              your interests."
Vietnam,The People,"The Vietnamese willingness to avoid unpleasantness can 
              sometimes lead to great misunderstandings. ""Yes"" may not mean 
              ""yes."" When the Vietnamese say ""No problem,"" you can take it to 
              mean ""Yes, there is a problem."" Double and even triple-check all 
              commitments, and then monitor them closely."
Vietnam,The People,"Your local partner in Vietnam is very important and should be 
              chosen very carefully."
Vietnam,The People,"Corruption is widespread. All manners of payoffs, kickbacks 
              and ""gifts"" are quite common. Be aware that corruption will not 
              only affect your costs, but also may contribute to unexpected 
              delays in delivery and the processing of licenses."
Vietnam,The People,Dining and Entertainment
Vietnam,The People,"A small dish or shaker of white crystal on the table is more 
              likely to be monosodium glutamate (MSG) than sugar or salt."
Vietnam,The People,"The Vietnamese style of dining is chopsticks and rice bowls. 
              Hold your rice bowl in your hand; it is considered lazy to eat 
              from a rice bowl that is on the table."
Vietnam,The People,"The host may serve guests, but will usually just invite 
              everyone to begin helping themselves. Food is placed on dishes in 
              the center of the table from which each person helps him/herself."
Vietnam,The People,"An offer of tea at a reception or meeting is a ritual form of 
              hospitality and should not be refused."
Vietnam,The People,Dress
Vietnam,The People,The Vietnamese dress very well.
Vietnam,The People,"For business, men should wear conservative but casual suits 
              and ties."
Vietnam,The People,"Women should wear a conservative dress or a businesslike 
              blouse and pants."
Vietnam,The People,Gifts
Vietnam,The People,Flowers are normally given only by men to women.
Vietnam,The People,Always wrap a gift in colorful paper.
Vietnam,The People,"When visiting a Vietnamese home, bring a gift for the hostess. 
              A gift for children or an elderly parent is also appreciated."
Vietnam,The People,"Give items useful for daily activity, like designer soaps, 
              cosmetics, lamps or framed pictures for the home."
Vietnam,The People,"Don't give handkerchiefs (symbols of a sad farewell). Most 
              Asians consider the Western habit of using a cloth handkerchief 
              and then returning it to your pocket to be barbaric."
Vietnam,The People,"In business, give whiskey. Giving a gift in an office setting 
              may be misinterpreted as a bribe. Try to save your business gift 
              giving until you are invited to your colleague's home."
Vietnam,The People,Helpful Hints
Vietnam,The People,"Walk quickly, and avoid eye contact on the street."
Vietnam,The People,"Refer to Ho Chi Minh City as Saigon. Local people prefer 
              Saigon to Ho Chi Minh City, which was imposed by the government in 
              Hanoi."
Vietnam,The People,Especially for Women
Vietnam,The People,"In the major cities, little sexual discrimination exists, and 
              Vietnamese women receive equal pay for equal work. In the country, 
              men are still boss."
Vietnam,The People,"Western women should dress conservatively in Vietnam. Women 
              who wear heavy makeup and revealing clothing are viewed as 
              prostitutes."
Vietnam,The People,"When dining with a Vietnamese man, a western businesswoman 
              should arrange to eat in a public place and should insist upon 
              hosting. If the Vietnamese man hosts, the Western woman is obliged 
              to reciprocate with a meal of equal value."
Vietnam,Meeting and Greeting,"The Vietnamese generally shake hands both when greeting and 
              when saying good-bye. Shake with both hands, and bow your head
