              children. It will be very well received."
Bolivia,Gifts,"Give your colleagues high quality pen and pencil sets, office 
              organizers, books and art from the United States and your home 
              region. If your company logo is on a gift, it should be small and 
              understated."
Bolivia,Helpful Hints,Know something about Bolivian sports. It will be appreciated.
Bolivia,Helpful Hints,"Don't talk about poverty, religion, drugs or the United 
              States' drug policy. The United States' military activity in 
              Bolivia is a sore spot with many citizens."
Bolivia,Helpful Hints,Do not give political opinions on Bolivia.
Bolivia,Helpful Hints,"Never praise Chile, Brazil or Paraguay. Bolivia has lost wars 
              with and land to all its neighbors."
Bolivia,Helpful Hints,"Make an effort to use Spanish in conversation. It will be 
              appreciated."
Bolivia,Helpful Hints,Bolivians appreciate people who are warm and friendly.
Bolivia,Especially for Women,"Machismo is very strong in Bolivia, and women are considered 
              subordinate. This puts severe restrictions on women's social and 
              work behavior."
Bolivia,Especially for Women,"When doing business with Bolivian men, emphasize your 
              credentials and experience."

Brazil,Meeting and Greeting,"Women kiss twice -- once on each cheek -- if they are married. 
              Single women add a third kiss."
Brazil,Body Language,"Physical contact is part of simple communication. Touching 
              arms, elbows and backs is very common and acceptable. Brazilians 
              also stand extremely close to one another. Do not back away."
Brazil,Body Language,"The ""O.K."" sign is considered very rude and vulgar; the 
              ""thumbs up"" gesture is used for approval."

              business endeavor."
Brazil,Corporate Culture,"Brazilians will do anything for friends, hence the expression: 
              ""For friends, everything. For enemies, the law."" Relationships are 
              more important than a legal document in business."
Brazil,Corporate Culture,"Meetings are conducted at a casual, unhurried pace. Don’t get 
              right down to business. Engage in conversation first."
Brazil,Corporate Culture,"Doing business with Brazilians requires face to face 
              communication. You will be able to do only limited business by 
              phone, fax or e-mail."
Brazil,Corporate Culture,"Some facts may not be completely accurate during the early 
              stages of business negotiations. Brazilians expect some initial 
              hype and will passionately argue their points, slowly and 
              grudgingly making concessions. Try to maintain consistency in your 
              negotiating team."
Brazil,Corporate Culture,"Always get a written agreement with starting date, time of

              your success."
Brazil,Corporate Culture,"Hire a local accountant and a lawyer to help you with contract

Brazil,Dining and Entertainment,"Be prepared for lengthy meals (two hours or more for lunch). 
              Do not discuss business during meals unless your host brings it 
              up. Business may occasionally be discussed at dinner in São Paulo 
              or Rio."
Brazil,Dining and Entertainment,"Brazilians always wash their hands before eating and rarely 
              touch food with their hands. Use a knife and fork for everything, 
              even fruit. Always use a napkin while eating or drinking."
Brazil,Dining and Entertainment,"Using toothpicks in public is not acceptable unless you cover 
              your mouth with your other hand."

              that your guests bring food or drink. Do not expect them to arrive 
              on time, and never indicate a time that the party will ""end."""
Brazil,Dining and Entertainment,"To beckon a waiter, hold up the index finger of your right 
              hand and quietly say ""Garçon."" To request the check, say ""A conta, 
              por favor."" Waiters generally don’t bring checks until they are 
              requested."
Brazil,Dress,"Appearance counts. Your clothing will reflect upon you and 
              your company."
Brazil,Dress,"Brazilian women dress ""sexy"" in all situations, whether 
              business, formal or casual. Foreign women who want to blend in 
              should avoid wearing overly formal, conservative attire."
Brazil,Dress,"Shoes should be stylish, polished and well-kept. Nails should 
              be manicured."
Brazil,Dress,"In business situations, men should wear conservative dark 
              suits, shirts and ties. Three piece suits indicate executives; two 
              piece suits indicate office workers. Women should wear feminine 
              dresses, suits and pantsuits and avoid ""dressing like a man."""
Brazil,Gifts,"Gifts are not important in establishing a business 
              relationship, and people won’t expect gifts in the first few 
              contacts. A very expensive gift may be viewed as a bribe."
Brazil,Gifts,"Present a gift at a social meeting, not during a formal 
              business meeting."

Brazil,Gifts,"Send flowers before or after visiting someone’s home for 
              dinner."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,"Don’t assume that the ""self-made"" businessperson is admired in 
              Brazil. Inherited wealth and a good family background are much 
              more desirable."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,"Brazilians are extremely casual about time. Being ten to 
              fifteen minutes late in business is normal, and twenty to thirty 
              minutes late is not unusual. Be on time for a formal meeting, but 
              prepare to wait for your Brazilian colleagues."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,"Soccer (football), family, Brazil’s beautiful beaches and the 
              country’s rapid growth are all appropriate conversation topics. 
              Politics, poverty, religion, Argentina (considered a rival) and 
              the deforestation of Brazil are not. Personal topics such as age, 
              salary and marital or job status are also unacceptable."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,"Brazilians are expressive and passionate conversationalists. 
              Be prepared to be interrupted."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,"Don’t smoke in public. Federal law bans smoking in public 
              places."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,Don’t refer to Brazilians as Latins.
Brazil,Especially for Women,"As women increasingly join the workforce, machismo has become 
            less common. Younger, better-educated women have values that 
            correspond closely to those of North American women. Women are 
            well-accepted and are prominent in education, medicine and 
            journalism and as small business owners."
Brazil,Especially for Women,"Brazilian women are very aggressive, in both their business 
              and personal lives."
Brazil,Especially for Women,"Foreign women will usually have no problem doing business in 
              Brazil. However, some people are still conservative in this 
              regard."
Brazil,Especially for Women,"Be very careful not to ruin a business deal by being cool and 
              too professional."
Brazil,Especially for Women,"It is traditional to invite someone for a drink after work. 
              This is not a come-on."
Brazil,Especially for Men,"Brazilian women can be very aggressive romantically and forward 
            to the point of harassment. Don’t be surprised if you are in a 
            restaurant or nightclub and a woman sends you a note asking for your 
            phone number — even if you are with your wife or girlfriend. Foreign 
            men traveling to Brazil should be very cautious when dealing with 
            Brazilian women. If you don’t want the attention, be cordial but 
            keep your distance. Don’t be overly friendly."

Canada,Regional Differences,"Atlantic Canada (includes the Maritimes -- Nova Scotia, New 
            Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island -- and Newfoundland): Primarily 
            of British descent, the residents of the less prosperous Atlantic 
            provinces of eastern Canada are generally more reserved, stolid, 
            provincial and old-fashioned. Newfoundland is unique, with a dialect 
            and culture that draws comparisons with the Irish and the people of 
            western England."
Canada,Regional Differences,"Ontario: Residents of Canada's most populous province -- the 
            country's economic, political and cultural colossus -- are generally 
            thought of as more business-like and conservative than other 
            Canadians."
Canada,Regional Differences,"Western Canada (includes Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba): 
            Residents of Canada's western provinces are generally more open, 
            relaxed, friendly and direct than other Canadians (comparisons are 
            often made with inhabitants of the western United States)."
Canada,Regional Differences,"British Columbia: Canada's unconventional westernmost province is 
            seen by Canadians as the land of the future, and has more in common 
            with Seattle than Toronto. Like many other western Canadians, many 
            residents of British Columbia feel somewhat estranged from 
            ""easterners"" (a general code word for those from Ontario and 
            Quebec)."
Canada,Regional Differences,"Quebec (and other areas of Francophone Canada): French Canadians, 
            and especially the Québécois (or citizens of Quebec, pronounced 
            ""keh-beck-wah"") have a very strong sense of cultural identity and 
            are very nationalistic. The European influence is strongly felt in 
            Quebec, whose people consider themselves the ""defenders of French 
            civilization in North America."" Because of their animated good 
            nature, Québécois are sometimes called the ""Latins of the North."""
Canada,Regional Differences,"The North: Residents of the sparsely populated north are seen as 
            rugged embodiments of the Canadian pioneer spirit."
Canada,Meeting and Greeting,"In general, Canadians are more reserved and polite than 
              Americans, and take matters of etiquette a little more seriously."
Canada,Meeting and Greeting,"Shake hands and introduce yourself when meeting Canadians for 
              the first time. Always shake hands firmly when meeting or 
              departing. Eye contact is important."
Canada,Meeting and Greeting,"When a woman enters or leaves a room, it is polite for men to 
              rise. Men normally offer their hands to women."
Canada,Meeting and Greeting,"In Quebec, kissing on the cheeks in the French manner is quite 
              common. When close friends and family meet in Quebec, they use 
              first names and kiss both cheeks."
Canada,Meeting and Greeting,"An older French Canadian man may kiss the hand of a woman. 
              Accept this gesture graciously. A foreign man shouldn't kiss the 
              hand of a French Canadian woman, who would be quite shocked."
Canada,Meeting and Greeting,"Canadians are somewhat more formal than Americans with regard 
              to names and titles. Use last names and appropriate titles until 
              invited by your Canadian hosts or colleagues to use their first 
              names. First names are normally used only by close friends and 
              family. Western Canadians may use first names more frequently than 
              other Canadians."
Canada,Meeting and Greeting,"In Quebec, coworkers of similiar status generally use first 
              names in private, but always last names in public. The formal 
              ""you"" is almost always used in a business setting, even after 20 
              years."
Canada,Meeting and Greeting,"Academic titles and degrees are important to French Canadians. 
              You should know and use them properly."
Canada,Language,"English and French are both official languages of business in 
              Canada. However, virtually all international business is conducted 
              in English."
Canada,Language,"Most French Canadians speak and understand English, but prefer 
              to use French. Check ahead of time to find out if an interpreter 
              will be necessary."
Canada,Body Language,"Generally speaking, Canadians are more reserved than 
              Americans. Canadians generally don't touch very much when 
              conversing. Maintaining a certain amount of personal space is 
              important."
Canada,Body Language,"French Canadians are generally more animated and expressive 
              than other Canadians."
Canada,Body Language,Take off your hat or sunglasses when speaking with someone.
Canada,Body Language,"Some gestures have different meanings in Quebec. For example, 
              ""thumbs down"" is considered offensive in Quebec, as is slapping an 
              open palm over a closed fist. Like the rest of their countrymen 
              and women, French-Canadians use the ""thumbs up"" sign to mean 
              ""okay. ""The ""okay"" sign made with the index finger and thumb means 
              ""zero"" in Quebec."
Canada,Body Language,"In Quebec, sit straight with your legs crossed at the knee, or 
              with your knees together. Don't sit with your legs apart, or with 
              your feet propped up on tables or chairs."
Canada,Body Language,"It's considered bad form by many in Quebec to talk with your 
              hands in your pockets."
Canada,Body Language,"Sneeze or blow your nose as quietly as possible using a 
              handkerchief or tissue. If possible, leave the room. Do not yawn 
              or scratch in public. Toothpicks, nail clippers, and combs are 
              never used in public."
Canada,Corporate Culture,"Punctuality is demanded for business meetings and social 
              occasions. If a conflict arises, you are expected to let your 
              Canadian counterpart know immediately. That said, Canadians are 
              not as obsessed with time as Americans."
Canada,Corporate Culture,Business cards are commonly exchanged in Canada.
Canada,Corporate Culture,"For Quebec, print your business cards in English or French, 
              including your academic degree(s) and/or title. A double-sided 
              business card (one side in English, one side in French) is best."
Canada,Corporate Culture,"Canadians get down to business quickly. Meetings are 
              well-organized, and extraneous discussion is kept to a minimum. A 
              premium is placed on time."
Canada,Corporate Culture,"Business communication is quite direct in Canada, but more 
              reserved than in the United States. Letters and telephone calls 
              should be direct and succinct. Pleasantries are dispensed with 
              very quickly."
Canada,Corporate Culture,"Business culture varies somewhat throughout Canada, depending 
              on the region."
Canada,Corporate Culture,"Although the relationship between Canada and the United States 
              is generally quite good, some Canadians may be wary about the 
              intentions of American businesses and put off by what they 
              perceive as American arrogance. Some Canadians may dislike the 
              American ""hard sell"" approach."
Canada,Dining and Entertainment,"To beckon a waiter in Quebec, quietly to say ""Monsieur"" or 
              ""S'il vous plait. Say ""Mademoiselle"" to beckon a waitress. Never 
              beckon a waiter or waitress by snapping your fingers or shouting."
Canada,Dining and Entertainment,"The host normally offers first toast. Wait until everyone is 
              served wine and a toast is proposed before drinking. It is 
              acceptable for women to propose a toast."
Canada,Dining and Entertainment,Wine is normally served with meals in Quebec.
Canada,Dining and Entertainment,"In Quebec, it's considered bad form to ask for a martini or 
              scotch before dinner — French Canadians consider them ""palate 
              numbing."" Typical before-dinner drinks include Pernod, kir, 
              champagne, and vermouth. Cognac, Grand Marnier and/or other 
              liqueurs are served after dinner."
Canada,Dining and Entertainment,"Business entertainment is common, but the focus usually 
              remains on business. The person who invites is normally expected 
              to pay."
Canada,Dining and Entertainment,"Etiquette and formalities are more important in Canada than in 
              the United States."
Canada,Dining and Entertainment,"While continental-style table manners are employed in Quebec, 
              American style table manners are seen in other parts of the 
              country."
Canada,Dining and Entertainment,"Eating while walking or standing on the street in Quebec is 
              considered bad form."
Canada,Dining and Entertainment,"Never arrive early for a social occasion. Opt, instead, for 
              being ""fashionably late."" Showing up early at a bar or disco in 
              Quebec (at, say, 10 o'clock) immediately marks you as an ""Anglo."""
Canada,Dress,"Generally speaking, Canadians dress more conservatively (and 
              more formally when going out) than their American neighbors, 
              although practices vary by region. Dress in Vancouver, for 
              example, is somewhat more casual; in Toronto more British. French 
              Canadians dress in a more relaxed European style than their fellow 
              Canadians."
Canada,Dress,"For business meetings, men should wear suits and ties; women 
              should wear conservative suits or dresses."
Canada,Gifts,"Bring flowers, fine wine or chocolates for the hostess when 
              invited to a Canadian home. Avoid red roses (associated with 
              romantic love) and white lilies (associated with funerals)."
Canada,Helpful Hints,"Do your homework about Canada. Most Americans are appallingly 
              ignorant of Canadian history, culture and geography."
Canada,Helpful Hints,"Recognize that important regional differences exist in Canada 
              and prepare to adapt."
Canada,Helpful Hints,"When in Quebec, learn a little French; Québécois greatly 
              appreciate it when you take the effort to talk to them in their 
              native language."
Canada,Helpful Hints,Do not compare Canada with the United States.
Canada,Helpful Hints,"Do not use the term ""Native Americans"" to refer to indigenous 
              peoples. Many Canadians find the term offensive. Canadians refer 
              to members of these groups as ""people of the First Nations."""
Canada,Helpful Hints,"Do not take sides in debates about contentious national issues 
              (especially when they concern such issues the status of Quebec, 
              the place of the French and English languages in Canadian society, 
              etc.)."

Chile,Corporate Culture,"Chileans don’t like to feel pressured or rushed. Business may 
              be conducted more slowly than in Europe and North America."
Chile,Corporate Culture,"Expertise is less important than your personal, family and 
              company background. Family and friendship play a big role in 
              business, and whom one knows is important. Red tape can be 
              minimized considerably if you have the right connections."
Chile,Corporate Culture,"Establish rapport first. Personal relationships are vital to

Chile,Corporate Culture,"Decision-making is centralized and decisions are made at the 
              top level, although all levels have input. Visit top-level 
              executives first. Mid-level executives can follow up on subsequent

Chile,Corporate Culture,"Be prepared to always go through a secretary. Secretaries are 
              screeners for their bosses."
Chile,Corporate Culture,"It is preferable to conduct business face-to-face rather than 
              over the phone or via fax. Be prepared to take several trips to 
              finish a business transaction."
Chile,Corporate Culture,"It is acceptable, but not yet common, to communicate via 
              e-mail; don’t expect a quick response."
Chile,Corporate Culture,"Businesslike behavior with a bit of humor is appreciated. Do 
              not attempt a hard sell approach, and avoid aggressive behavior."

              hostess on the meal."
Chile,Dining and Entertainment,"Conversation is free, friendly and open at the table, but be 
              careful not to speak with food in your mouth."
Chile,Dining and Entertainment,"Never leave immediately after dinner. Stay for conversation 
              after the meal."
Chile,Dining and Entertainment,"An invitation for drinks at a private home generally includes 
              dinner. Guests should reciprocate with comparable hospitality at a 
              later time."
Chile,Dining and Entertainment,"There are no separate checks. The person who invites pays. 
              Arrange in advance to pay the bill in a restaurant if you are the 
              host. You will not be presented with a bill in a restaurant until 
              you ask for it."
Chile,Dining and Entertainment,"Always arrive late for social functions. Being fifteen to 
              thirty minutes late for dinner and thirty minutes late for a party 
              is customary."
Chile,Dress,"Appearance is important to Chileans who favor sophisticated 
              European styles. It is important to be neatly and cleanly dressed 
              for all occasions."
Chile,Dress,"Men should wear jackets regardless of where they are or how 
              hot it is. Conservative, dark suits should be worn for business."
Chile,Dress,"Women should wear dresses and suits for business. Bare legs 
              are acceptable with dresses."
Chile,Dress,Chilean women do not favor overtly sexy clothing.
Chile,Gifts,"Business gifts are not expected until a relationship is 
              formed."

              conservative."

              lighters, office accessories, a clock or liquor."
Chile,Gifts,Open gifts immediately in front of the giver.
Chile,Gifts,"Bring a bouquet of flowers to the hostess, or send flowers in 
              advance of a party. Give wine, chocolates, local crafts from your 
              home, small porcelain pieces or an art object to hang on a wall. 
              Gifts for children are appreciated."
Chile,Helpful Hints,Do not make comparisons between the United States and Chile.
Chile,Helpful Hints,"Show interest in and talk about family, especially children."
Chile,Helpful Hints,"Do not talk about politics or human rights, especially as a 
              foreigner, unless your host initiates the discussion."
Chile,Helpful Hints,"When smoking, offer a cigarette to everyone. Chileans have a 
              saying for those who neglect to share: ""Did you learn to smoke in 
              jail?"""
Chile,Especially for Women,"Traditionally, men have dominated private and public life in 
            Chile. However, attitudes are changing at home and in the workplace. 
            Women now make up 30% of the labor. In addition, many women hold 
            important political and business positions as ministers and top 
            executives."
Chile,Especially for Women,"Chile is an easier place for women to conduct business than 
              other parts of South America. However, businesswomen may still 
              encounter a machismo ethic."
Chile,Especially for Women,"Typical North American businesswomen are often viewed as cold, 
              pushy and non-feminine."
Chile,Especially for Women,"Men almost always pay the bill in a restaurant and may be 
              embarrassed if a woman attempts to pay. This shouldn’t be pressed. 
              Don’t argue. If it is important for you to pay, make arrangements 
              in advance."
Chile,Especially for Women,"It is common for men to stare at women. It is harmless and 
              meant to flatter."

China,Meeting and Greeting,"Shake hands upon meeting. Chinese may nod or bow instead of 
              shaking hands, although shaking hands has become increasingly 
              common."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"When introduced to a Chinese group, they may greet you with 
              applause. Applaud back."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Senior persons begin greetings. Greet the oldest, most senior 
              person before others. During group introductions, line up 
              according to seniority with the senior person at the head of the 
              line."
China,Names and Titles,"Use family names and appropriate titles until specifically 
              invited by your Chinese host or colleagues to use their given 
              names."
China,Names and Titles,"Address the Chinese by Mr., Mrs., Miss plus family name. Note: 
              married women always retain their maiden name."
China,Names and Titles,"Chinese are often addressed by their government or 
              professional titles. For example, address Li Pang using his title: 
              Mayor Li or Director Li."
China,Names and Titles,"Names may have two parts; for example: Wang Chien. Traditional 
              Chinese family names are placed first with the given name (which 
              has one or two syllables) coming last (family name: Wang; given: 
              Chien)."
China,Names and Titles,"Chinese generally introduce their guests using their full 
              titles and company names. You should do the same. Example: Doctor 
              John Smith, CEO of American Data Corporation."
China,Body Language,"The Chinese dislike being touched by strangers. Do not touch, 
              hug, lock arms, back slap or make any body contact."
China,Body Language,Clicking fingers or whistling is considered very rude.
China,Body Language,"Never put your feet on a desk or a chair. Never gesture or 
              pass an object with your feet."
China,Body Language,"Blowing one's nose in a handkerchief and returning it to one's 
              pocket is considered vulgar by the Chinese."
China,Body Language,"To beckon a Chinese person, face the palm of your hand 
              downward and move your fingers in a scratching motion. Never use 
              your index finger to beckon anyone."
China,Body Language,"Sucking air in quickly and loudly through lips and teeth 
              expresses distress or surprise at a proposed request. Attempt to 
              change your request, allowing the Chinese to save face."
China,Body Language,"Chinese point with an open hand. Never point with your index 
              finger."
China,Corporate Culture,"The Chinese are practical in business and realize they need 
            Western investment, but dislike dependency on foreigners. They are 
            suspicious and fearful of being cheated or pushed around by 
            foreigners, who are perceived as culturally and economically 
            corrupt. It is very difficult to break through the ""them vs. us"" 
            philosophy (foreign partner vs. Chinese). In personal relationships, 
            the Chinese will offer friendship and warm hospitality without 
            conflict, but in business they are astute negotiators."
China,Corporate Culture,"Punctuality is important for foreign businesspeople. Being 
              late is rude. Meetings always begin on time."
China,Corporate Culture,"Business cards are exchanged upon meeting. Business cards 
              should be printed in English on one side and Chinese on the other. 
              Make sure the Chinese side uses ""simplified"" characters and not 
              ""classical"" characters, which are used in Taiwan and Hong Kong."
China,Corporate Culture,"English is not spoken in business meetings, although some 
              Chinese may understand English without making it known. Hire an 
              interpreter or ask for one to be provided."
China,Corporate Culture,"Be prepared for long meetings and lengthy negotiations (often 
              ten days straight) with many delays."
China,Corporate Culture,"The Chinese will enter a meeting with the highest-ranking 
              person entering first. They will assume the first member of your 
              group to enter the room is the leader of your delegation. The 
              senior Chinese person welcomes everyone. The foreign leader 
              introduces his/her team, and each member distributes his/her card. 
              The leader invites the Chinese to do the same."
China,Corporate Culture,"Seating is very important at a meeting. The host sits to the 
              left of the most important guest."
China,Corporate Culture,"There may be periods of silence at a business meeting; do not 
              interrupt these."
China,Corporate Culture,"A contract is considered a draft subject to change. Chinese 
              may agree on a deal and then change their minds. A signed contract 
              is not binding and does not mean negotiations will end."
China,Corporate Culture,"Observing seniority and rank are extremely important in 
              business."
China,Corporate Culture,"The status of the people who make the initial contact with the 
              Chinese is very important. Don't insult the Chinese by sending 
              someone with a low rank."
China,Corporate Culture,"Chinese negotiators may try to make foreign negotiators feel 
              guilty about setbacks; they may then manipulate this sense of 
              guilt to achieve certain concessions."
China,Corporate Culture,"Two Chinese negotiating tricks designed to make you agree to 
              concessions are staged temper tantrums and a feigned sense of 
              urgency."
China,Corporate Culture,"If the Chinese side no longer wishes to pursue the deal, they 
              may not tell you. To save their own face, they may become 
              increasingly inflexible and hard-nosed, forcing you to break off 
              negotiations. In this way, they may avoid blame for the failure."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Dining is used to probe positions without any formal 
              commitment. Business is generally not discussed during meals. 
              Meals are a vehicle for indirect business references."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"The Chinese are superb hosts. Twelve-course banquets with 
              frequent toasts are a Chinese trademark."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"The Chinese sponsoring organization generally hosts a 
              welcoming banquet. Foreign guests should reciprocate toward the 
              end of their visits. Invite everyone with whom you have dealt."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Always arrive exactly on time for a banquet. Never arrive 
              early for dinner. This implies that you are hungry and might cause 
              you to lose face."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Spouses are not usually included in business entertaining, 
              however, businesspeople may bring their secretaries."
China,Dining and Entertainment,Be prepared to make a small toast for all occasions.
China,Dining and Entertainment,"The first toast normally occurs during or after the first 
              course, not before. After the next course, the guest should 
              reciprocate."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Three glasses -- a large one for beer, soda or mineral water, 
              a small wine glass and a stemmed shot glass -- are at each place 
              setting. The shot glass is the one used for toasting."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"It is not necessary to always drain your glass after a ganbei 
              (bottoms up), although a host should encourage it."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Do not drink until you toast others at the table. Chinese 
              consider drinking alone to be rude. Simply raising your glass and 
              making eye contact is sufficient. If you are toasted, sip your 
              drink in reply."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"A toast to friendship among companies will help cement a 
              business relationship."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Unless you are totally drunk, it is not advised to refuse a 
              drink. Sipping your drink is perfectly acceptable."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Leave some food on your plate during each course of a meal to 
              honor the generosity of your host. It is bad manners for a Chinese 
              host not to keep refilling guests' plates or teacups."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Seating is very important. The guest of honor is always placed 
              at the head of the room, facing the door. Allow the host to begin 
              eating before joining in."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Do not discuss business at dinner unless your Chinese 
              counterpart initiates it."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Slurping soup and belching are acceptable. Cover your mouth 
              with your hand when using a toothpick. Put bones, seeds, etc. on 
              the table, never in your rice bowl."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Chopsticks are used for all meals. Tapping your chopsticks on 
              the table is considered very rude."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"When finished eating, place your chopsticks neatly on the 
              table or on the chopstick rest."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"When hosting, order one dish for every person present and one 
              extra. In addition, order rice, noodles and buns. Soup usually 
              comes at some point during the meal. The host should tell his/her 
              guests to begin eating a new dish before he digs in himself."
China,Dining and Entertainment,The host (the one who invites) pays the bill for everyone.
China,Dining and Entertainment,"If you are the guest of honor at a dinner, leave shortly after 
              the meal is finished, as no one will leave before the guest of 
              honor."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Breakfast meetings are rare, but you may request one."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Guests are rarely invited to a Chinese home. It is an honor to 
              be a guest. Be on time or a little early for an invitation, and 
              take a small gift."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Bedrooms and kitchens are private. Don't enter these rooms 
              unless you are invited to do so."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"All dishes are served at once in a home. The host will place 
              portions of each dish on guests' plates. Sample each dish."
China,Dining and Entertainment,Rare beef is considered barbaric by the Chinese.
China,Dress,"Conservative, simple, unpretentious, modest clothing should be 
              worn -- nothing flashy or overly fashionable."
China,Dress,"Women should avoid bare backs, shorts, low-cut tops and 
              excessive jewelry."
China,Dress,"For business, men should wear sport coats and ties. Slacks and 
              open-necked shirts are generally suitable in the summer for 
              business meetings; jackets and ties are not necessary."
China,Dress,"Women should wear dresses or pantsuits for business and should 
              avoid heavy make-up and dangling, gaudy jewelry."
China,Gifts,"Present a gift with both hands. Gifts are generally not opened 
              upon receiving. Always give a gift to everyone present or don't 
              give gifts at all."
China,Gifts,"Older Chinese usually refuse a gift at first to be polite. 
              Offer a second time."
China,Gifts,"Never give a gift of great value until a clear relationship is 
              established. This would cause embarrassment and may not be 
              accepted. Never give gifts in sets (i.e., dishes), but never in 
              sets of four (a number associated with death)."
China,Gifts,"Avoid white, which is symbolic of death, especially of 
              parents, and black, which symbolizes tragedy or death."
China,Gifts,"When invited to someone's home, always bring a small gift for 
              the hostess, such as brandy, chocolates or cakes."
China,Gifts,"Be prepared to exchange a modest gift with your business 
              colleagues at the first meeting. Not giving a gift could start a 
              business meeting off on the wrong foot."
China,Gifts,"Always give gifts to each member of the Chinese delegation 
              that meets you in the order in which they were introduced. 
              Suggested gifts: cigarettes (especially Marlboro and Kent), French 
              brandy, whiskey, pens, lighters, desk attire, cognac, books, 
              framed paintings. Give more valuable gifts — like cellular phones 
              or small CD players — to senior level people."
China,Gifts,"Give a group gift from your company to the host company. 
              Present this gift to the leader of the delegation."
China,Helpful Hints,"Chinese find ""no"" difficult to say. They may say ""maybe"" or 
              ""we'll see"" in order to save face."
China,Helpful Hints,"Always refer to China as ""China"" or ""People's Republic of 
              China,"" never as ""Red China,"" ""Communist China"" or ""Mainland 
              China."""
China,Helpful Hints,"Always refer to Taiwan as ""Taiwan"" or ""Province of Taiwan,"" 
              never ""China,"" ""Republic of China"" (the name adapted by the 
              Nationalist forces after they fled to Taiwan) or ""Free China."""
China,Helpful Hints,Do not in any way suggest that Taiwan is not part of China.
China,Helpful Hints,"Show respect for older people. Offer a seat or right of way 
              through the door to a colleague or older person as a polite 
              gesture."
China,Helpful Hints,Return applause when applauded.
China,Helpful Hints,"Refrain from being loud, boisterous or showy."
China,Helpful Hints,"Do not be insulted if the Chinese ask personal questions such 
              as ""How much money do you make?"" ""How many children do you have?"" 
              or ""Are you married?"" Just change the subject if you do not want 
              to answer."
China,Helpful Hints,"Asking about divorce would cause a Chinese person to lose 
              face."
China,Helpful Hints,"Forcing the Chinese to say ""no"" will quickly end a 
              relationship."
China,Helpful Hints,"Never say or act like you are starving and don’t ask for a 
              doggy bag."
China,Helpful Hints,"Most Chinese women don't wear wedding rings. Don't assume 
              marital status."
China,Especially for Women,"China is a difficult place for anyone to conduct business. A 
              woman may gain acceptance, but it will take time and will not be 
              easy."
China,Especially for Women,"China is a male-dominated society. However, there are many 
              women in business in China and some occupy high-ranking positions 
              and important managerial jobs. One of the principles of the 
              Chinese communist system is to work toward sexual equality."
China,Especially for Women,"Negotiating teams may have women members. Women may be used to 
              decline unpopular proposals."
China,Especially for Women,"Businesswomen attend business dinners, but rarely bring their 
              spouses."
China,Especially for Women,"Chinese women rarely smoke or drink. However, it is acceptable 
              for Western women to do so moderately."

Colombia,Meeting and Greeting,Shake hands with everyone when entering or leaving a room.
Colombia,Body Language,Smiling is very important.
Colombia,Body Language,"Never put your feet on furniture in a hotel, office or home."
Colombia,Body Language,"Yawning is impolite and viewed as a sign of hunger or 
              sleepiness. Always cover your mouth when yawning."
Colombia,Body Language,"It is considered demeaning to beckon someone with your index 
              finger. Instead, beckon with your palm down, waving your fingers 
              or your whole hand."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"Colombians are normally punctual in business, although they 
              may be up to a half-hour late. The best policy for foreign 
              businesspeople is to be punctual, but prepared to wait. Don't get 
              angry if a 12:00 p.m. appointment doesn't begin until 12:30 p.m. 
              Excuse yourself if you are late."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"“In an hour or two” may mean tomorrow or next week. “Tomorrow” 
              seldom means tomorrow and may mean next week. Don't get offended 
              if someone says they will phone you tomorrow and then calls a week 
              later."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"Colombians want to know you personally before they do business 
              with you. You must develop a relationship with your counterparts 
              before they will consider you trustworthy."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"Always allow your Colombian counterparts to bring up the 
              subject of business. Be aware that this may take awhile. Meetings 
              may be slow, with quiet, deliberate discussions."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"Follow up a meeting by sending a letter summarizing the main 
              points and what was agreed upon."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"It may take several trips to complete a business transaction. 
              Colombians prefer to do business in person -- one can only get “so 
              far” by phone and fax."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"Maintain eye contact during conversations, or you may leave a 
              bad impression."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"Contracts may be long and detailed. Put the key aspects of 
              agreed-upon points in writing."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"Third-party contacts are vital to business success. You should 
              hire a local distributor, representative, salesperson and/or 
              lawyer."
Colombia,Dining and Entertainment,"Time and punctuality are not stressed. Colombians will 
              typically arrive up to thirty minutes late for social engagements. 
              A 10:00 p.m. party will often begin a half-hour to one hour late."
Colombia,Dining and Entertainment,"Working breakfasts are common, and business lunches and 
              dinners are popular. Plan on spending at least two or three hours 
              at either."
Colombia,Dress,"Colombians pay a lot of attention to appearance and clothing. 
              Dress conservatively and be well groomed."
Colombia,Dress,"Shoes are the first thing people notice. Colombians do not 
              wear tennis shoes unless they are playing tennis, jogging, etc."
Colombia,Dress,"For business, men should wear dark suits, white shirts and 
              ties in the cities. In warmer areas, dress is less formal. Women 
              should wear dresses and suits. Wear comfortable cotton in warmer 
              areas."
Colombia,Gifts,Gifts made in America are well-received.
Colombia,Gifts,"Give personal gifts, like clothing and perfume, only when you 
              know people well."
Colombia,Gifts,"Bring your hostess fruit, flowers or chocolates. Send flowers 
              ahead of time, if possible. Roses are a favorite."
Colombia,Gifts,"Give your colleagues fine scotch and wines, engraved pens, 
              calculators and gifts from your home region."
Colombia,Helpful Hints,Don't offer your opinions about local politics or religion.
Colombia,Helpful Hints,"Be prudent when you talk about drugs. Colombia is working with 
              the United States' government in the war against drugs, but U.S. 
              foreign policy is not viewed positively by many Colombians."
Colombia,Helpful Hints,"If you are invited to a bullfight, do not decline. Tickets for 
              good seats are very expensive."
Colombia,Helpful Hints,"Do not be offended if you are called a “gringo.” Colombians 
              use this term to refer to people from the United States, and it is 
              not meant to be insulting."
Colombia,Helpful Hints,"Colombians consider Panama to have been stolen from them bynorteamericanoseager to build the Panama Canal. Try to stay 
              away from this touchy subject."
Colombia,Especially for Women,"A woman in the workforce is treated as any man, 
              notwithstanding special courtesy and manners."
Colombia,Especially for Women,"United States businesswomen are received well in Colombia and 
              will be treated in a businesslike manner, although perhaps with 
              some curiosity. North American women should not have trouble doing 
              business in Colombia."

              rank. An older person comes before a younger person, and a woman

              entrance, etc. and positions office furniture to be in harmony 
              with cosmic forces. Do not ignore this custom. Many Chinese will 
              not do business without feng shui approval for fear of trouble

              attached) to signal the waiter for more tea."

              is served."
Hong Kong,Dining and Entertainment,"Be sure to eat and show appreciation for shark fin soup if it 
              is offered. This delicacy is offered only to special guests, and 
              is very expensive."
Hong Kong,Dining and Entertainment,"It is bad manners for a host not to keep a guest's plate full, 
              and it is even worse for a guest not to continue eating as long as 
              the plate is full. Always leave some food on your dish after you 
              are finished with each course. Otherwise the host will continue 
              refilling your plate or bowl."

              hotel can assist you in preparations."

              table when you are finished eating. Never stick them in a bowl of 
              rice."

              Modesty and cleanliness are very important."
Hong Kong,Dress,"All types of clothing are worn in Hong Kong. However, taste 
              and fashion look more toward Japan than Britain or the United

              jackets for winter."
Hong Kong,Dress,"For business, men should wear conservative and lightweight 
              Western-style suits and ties. Women should wear conservative 
              dresses, suits or skirts and blouses."
Hong Kong,Dress,Wear a good watch. It will be noticed.
Hong Kong,Dress,"The Chinese tend to dress up when going out in the evening.

              the evening. Women should wear cocktail dresses or evening pants."
Hong Kong,Gifts,"Gift giving is a tradition in Hong Kong that communicates 
              respect and friendship. Be prepared to present a small gift at the

Hong Kong,Gifts,"The word for the number ""3"" in Chinese sounds like the word 
              for ""life,"" and the word for the number ""8"" sounds like the word 
              for ""prosperity."" The Chinese word for number ""9"" is a homonym for 
              the word ""eternity."" Give gifts in these numbers, if possible. Do 
              not give gifts in a group of four; the Chinese word for ""4"" sounds 
              similar to the word for ""death."""
Hong Kong,Gifts,"Avoid giving white or red flowers (white is a symbol of 
              mourning, red is a symbol of blood); clocks are associated with

India,Meeting and Greeting,"Men shake hands with men when meeting or leaving. Men do not 
              touch women when meeting or greeting. Western women may offer 
              their hand to a westernized Indian man, but not normally to 
              others. Traditional Indian women may shake hands with foreign 
              women but not usually with men."
India,Body Language,Public displays of affection are not proper.

India,Body Language,"Feet are considered unclean. Feet are sacred for holy men and 
              women. Pointing footwear at people is considered an insult."
India,Body Language,"Indians are very sensitive to being beckoned rudely. Hand and 
              arm waved up and down (Western ""good-bye"") means ""come here."" To

              persistent. Do not get angry if you are told something ""can't be

India,Dining and Entertainment,"Allow hosts to serve you. Never refuse food, but don’t feel

Indonesia,Meeting and Greeting,"Shake hands and give a slight nod when meeting for the first 
              time. After the first meeting, a handshake is not necessary; a 
              slight bow or nod of the head is sufficient. Shake an Indonesian 
              woman's hand only if she initiates the greeting."
Indonesia,Meeting and Greeting,"Greet people with ""Selamat"" (sell-a-mat), which means peace. 
              Say it slowly and sincerely."
Indonesia,Body Language,"Good relationships involve a great deal of physical contact 
              and touching. But, foreigners should allow time to be accepted and 
              to develop good relationships before this is acceptable."
Indonesia,Body Language,"Indonesians are used to an overcrowded society; they tend to 
              ignore inadvertent invasions of space. Allowing for personal space 
              is a sign of respect."
Indonesia,Body Language,"A man does not touch a woman in public except to shake hands. 
              Do not display affection in public."

Indonesia,Body Language,"Keep both feet on the floor when sitting. Do not cross your 
              legs, especially not with an ankle over the knee. Sitting with 
              good posture (rigid) and both feet on the floor is a sign of 
              respect. Don’t allow the bottom of your feet to face or point at 
              another person."
Indonesia,Body Language,"Looking someone straight in the eyes is considered staring. 
              Avoid prolonged eye contact, which may be viewed as a challenge

Indonesia,Body Language,"Point with your thumb, not your index finger. Never beckon 
              with one finger."

              American-style backslapping is considered offensive."
Indonesia,Corporate Culture,"Westerners are expected to be punctual for business 
              appointments. Call if you are delayed. It is very common for 
              Indonesians to arrive late."
Indonesia,Corporate Culture,"Present your business card to the receptionist immediately 
              upon arrival; otherwise, there could be long delays. Exchange 
              business cards when being introduced. Present and receive the card 
              slowly with much interest. Cards in English are acceptable."

              the company."
Indonesia,Corporate Culture,"It is best to conduct a first meeting with the highest ranking 
              person of a company. An introduction from a local associate or 
              bank representative is helpful."
Indonesia,Corporate Culture,"Indonesians don't get right down to business. An initial 
              meeting may last 45-60 minutes without accomplishing much. After 
              this amount of time, the visitor should initiate leaving."
Indonesia,Corporate Culture,"Patience is a necessity when doing business in Indonesia. 
              Business dealings are usually slow, long and frustrating. Business 
              relationships must be allowed to develop over time. Several visits 
              are generally necessary to complete a contract."
Indonesia,Corporate Culture,"Indonesians love to bargain. Giving concessions too quickly 
              will be viewed as naivete."

              negotiations. Avoid disagreement and, especially, arguments with 
              Indonesians."
Indonesia,Corporate Culture,"To Indonesians, insisting on a written contract is a breech of 
              trust, though many understand a Westerner’s need for such 
              documents. A contract should be viewed as a guideline rather than 
              a statement of duties and responsibilities."
Indonesia,Corporate Culture,"Personal visits are important to Indonesians. They do not take 
              well to faxes, telephone calls or messages. Show up in person 
              whenever possible."
Indonesia,Corporate Culture,"Indonesians want very much to please. An untruthful answer may 
              be given so as not to disappoint anyone."
Indonesia,Corporate Culture,"Indonesians rarely disagree in public. To succeed in 
              negotiations with Indonesians, do not apply pressure or be 
              confrontational."
Indonesia,Dining and Entertainment,"Social events generally start late. Indonesians usually arrive

              by Indonesians."

Indonesia,Dining and Entertainment,Most Indonesians are Muslim and consume no liquor or pork.
Indonesia,Dining and Entertainment,"Indonesians are known for their hospitality. Do not reject 
              their hospitality, as it will be viewed as a personal rejection. 
              Never refuse food or drink, but never finish either completely. 
              Compliments about the food are appreciated. It is a special honor 
              to be invited to an Indonesian's home."
Indonesia,Dining and Entertainment,"The host is always the last to sit and eat. Men are generally 
              served first. Wait to be invited to eat or drink."
Indonesia,Dining and Entertainment,"The guest of honor or senior person begins the meal; this is a 
              distinct honor. If you are asked to begin the meal, you should 
              refuse twice and then begin."
Indonesia,Dining and Entertainment,"Fingers are still used for eating in some places. Both hands 
              are kept above the table while eating."
Indonesia,Dining and Entertainment,"The person who invites is expected to pay the bill in a

              your plate with your spoon (down) crossed over the fork."
Indonesia,Dining and Entertainment,"If possible, reciprocate with a dinner before you leave the

              hospitable, but don't overdo it."
Indonesia,Dress,"Men should wear a suit and jacket for the first business 
              meeting."
Indonesia,Dress,"Women should wear skirts and blouses (never sleeveless) or 
              dresses. Avoid extreme fashions. Muslim rules of modesty should be 
              honored."
Indonesia,Gifts,"Business gifts are generally not exchanged. A small token of 
              appreciation may be given to secretaries. Gifts to colleagues 
              should be given after most business has been concluded."
Indonesia,Gifts,"Receive a gift appreciatively. It is impolite to refuse a 
              gift. Gifts are not opened in the giver's presence except at a 
              ceremony, where the gift is opened in front of an assembled group."

              may ask to take your picture."

              workers. Never treat them as though they are your servants."

              sometime in the future. Set specific dates and times for 
              arrangements."
Indonesia,Helpful Hints,Do not chew gum or yawn in public.
Indonesia,Especially for Women,"Indonesia is a Muslim society and very male-oriented, but most 
              female visitors experience very few hassles with men. However, 
              blond-haired, blue-eyed women may be hassled more often than dark 
              women. It helps if you dress modestly."
Indonesia,Especially for Women,"Businesswomen may invite an Indonesian businessman and his 
              wife to dinner. Arrange payment in advance to avoid embarrassment

              presentations are not common."

              regarded greeting to show respect and is appreciated by the 
              Japanese. A slight bow to show courtesy is acceptable."
Japan,Body Language,"Nodding is very important. When listening to Japanese speak,

              not beckon older people."
Japan,Body Language,"Sit erect with both feet on the floor. Never sit with ankle 
              over knee."
Japan,Body Language,"Waving a hand back and forth with palm forward in front of

              appreciated."
Japan,Corporate Culture,"Japanese may exchange business cards even before they shake 
              hands or bow. Be certain your business card clearly states your 
              rank. This will determine who your negotiating counterpart should 
              be."
Japan,Corporate Culture,"Bear in mind that initial negotiations begin with middle 
              managers. Do not attempt to go over their heads to senior 
              management."
Japan,Corporate Culture,"It is acceptable to use a Japanese company interpreter in the 
              first meeting. Once negotiations begin, hire your own interpreter."

              Older people have higher status than younger, men higher than 
              women and senior executives higher than junior executives."
Japan,Corporate Culture,"It is very important to send a manager of the same rank to 
              meet with a Japanese colleague. Title is very important."
Japan,Corporate Culture,"Work is always undertaken as a group. The workgroup is 
              strongly united with no competition; all succeed or all fail. 
              Decision-making is by consensus. Everyone on the work team must be 
              consulted before making decisions. This is a very slow process."
Japan,Corporate Culture,"The first meeting may focus on establishing an atmosphere of 
              friendliness, harmony and trust. Business meetings are conducted 
              formally, so leave your humor behind. Always allow ten minutes of 
              polite conversation before beginning business meetings."
Japan,Corporate Culture,"It takes several meetings to develop a contract. When the time 
              comes, be content to close a deal with a handshake. Leave the 
              signing of the written contract to later meetings."
Japan,Corporate Culture,"Etiquette and harmony are very important. ""Saving face"" is a 
              key concept. Japanese are anxious to avoid unpleasantness and 
              confrontation. Try to avoid saying ""no."" Instead, say, ""This could 
              be very difficult,"" allowing colleagues to save face."
Japan,Corporate Culture,"Proper introduction to business contacts is a must. The 
              introducer becomes a guarantor for the person being introduced."

              relationships based on trust. The Japanese do not like complicated 
              legal documents. Write contracts that cover essential points."
Japan,Dining and Entertainment,"Restaurant entertaining is crucial to business. A person is 
              judged by his/her behavior during and after business hours. Seldom 
              is a business deal completed without dinner in a restaurant."
Japan,Dining and Entertainment,"Drinking is a group activity. Do not say ""no"" when offered a 
              drink."
Japan,Dining and Entertainment,"An empty glass is the equivalent of asking for another drink. 
              Keep your glass at least half full if you do not want more. If a 
              Japanese person attempts to pour more and you do not want it, put 
              your hand over your glass, or fill it with water if necessary."
Japan,Dining and Entertainment,"An empty plate signals a desire for more food. Leave a little 
              food on your plate when you are finished eating."
Japan,Dining and Entertainment,"When drinking with a Japanese person, fill his glass or cup 
              after he has filled yours. While he is pouring, hold your cup or 
              glass up so he can fill it easily. Never pour your own drink and 
              always pour your companion's."
Japan,Dining and Entertainment,"Toasting is very important in Japan and many toasts are 
              offered during the course of an evening. At dinner, wait for the 
              toast before you drink. Respond to each toast with a toast."
Japan,Dining and Entertainment,"Wait for the most important person (honored guest) to begin 
              eating. If you are the honored guest, wait until all the food is 
              on the table and everyone is ready before you eat."
Japan,Dining and Entertainment,"When offered food, it is polite to hesitate before accepting. 
              You do not have to eat much, but it is rude not to sample each 
              dish."
Japan,Dining and Entertainment,"It is acceptable to slurp noodles. Some Japanese believe that 
              it makes them taste better."
Japan,Dining and Entertainment,"Do not finish your soup before eating other foods. It should 
              accompany your meal. Replace the lid of the soup bowl when 
              finished eating."
Japan,Dress,"Dress is modern and conservative. The Japanese dress well at 
              all times. Dress smartly for parties, even if an invitation says 
              ""Casual"" or ""Come as you are."""
Japan,Dress,"For business, men should wear dark suits and ties (subtle 
              colors)."
Japan,Dress,"Women should wear dresses, suits and shoes with heels. Subtle 
              colors and conservative styles are best for business."
Japan,Gifts,"The ritual of gift giving is more important than the value of 
              the gift."
Japan,Gifts,"Allow your Japanese counterpart to initiate the gift giving. 
              Present a gift in a modest fashion, saying, ""This is just a small 
              token,"" or ""This is an insignificant gift."""
Japan,Gifts,"It is very important to receive a gift properly. Give a gift 
              and receive a gift with both hands and a slight bow. The Japanese 
              may refuse a gift once or twice before accepting it."
Japan,Gifts,"Do not give anyone a gift unless you have one for everyone 
              present."
Japan,Gifts,"Correct wrapping is very important. Appearance counts for as 
              much or more than the contents."
Japan,Gifts,"Be prepared to give and receive a gift at a first business 
              meeting. Gifts are frequently given at the end of a first meeting. 
              Not giving a proper gift could ruin a business relationship."
Japan,Helpful Hints,"Avoid using the number ""four"" if possible. It has connotations 
              of death to the Japanese."
Japan,Helpful Hints,"The Japanese may ask personal questions. This is not intended 
              to be rude, but rather a polite way to show interest. You may give 
              vague or general answers if you feel a question is too personal."
Japan,Helpful Hints,"The Japanese do not express opinions and desires openly. What 
              they say and what they mean may be very different."
Japan,Helpful Hints,"Do not expect a Japanese person to say ""no."" ""Maybe"" generally 
              means ""no."""
Japan,Especially for Women,"Non-Japanese women are treated very politely in business and 
              it is understood that Western women hold high-level positions in 
              business. Western women must establish credibility and a position 
              of authority immediately."
Japan,Especially for Women,"A non-Japanese woman is viewed first as a foreigner and then 
              as a woman and is treated accordingly."
Japan,Especially for Women,"Businesswomen can invite a Japanese businessman to lunch or 
              dinner. Allow your Japanese colleague to pick the restaurant."

              detailed."

              dinner invitation can substitute for a gift."

              the presence of the giver."

              Family background, social position and status are all important."

              opportunities and misfortunes result from fate or the will of God."
Malaysia,Helpful Hints,"Don't be surprised if Malays ask personal questions about your 
              income, religion, etc. You may ask the same questions. There is no

Mexico,Meeting and Greeting,Shake hands or give a slight bow when introduced.
Mexico,Meeting and Greeting,"Bow when greeting a Mexican woman. Shake hands only if she 
              extends her hand first."
Mexico,Body Language,"Mexicans generally stand close together when conversing. Don't 
              show signs of discomfort, which would be considered rude by your 
              Mexican counterpart."
Mexico,Body Language,"Mexicans often ""hold"" a gesture (a handshake, a squeeze of the 
              arm, a hug) longer than Americans and Canadians do."
Mexico,Body Language,"Don't stand with your hands on your hips; this signifies 
              anger. It is considered rude to stand around with your hands in 
              your pockets."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Punctuality is expected of foreign businesspeople. Your 
              Mexican counterpart may be late or keep you waiting. Thirty 
              minutes past the scheduled meeting time is considered punctual by 
              Mexicans."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Spanish is the language of business. You may need to hire an 
              interpreter (preferably a native speaker who understands the 
              language as it is spoken in Mexico)."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Meet with top executives first. Top-level Mexican executives 
              may not attend subsequent meetings, which often take place with 
              middle-level management and technical people. Don't feel insulted; 
              this shows that discussions are proceeding positively."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Negotiations move slowly. Be patient. For Mexicans, the 
              building of a personal relationship comes before the building of a 
              professional one."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Expect approximately ten to fifteen minutes of small talk 
              before getting down to business."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"If offered something to drink (usually coffee), don't refuse. 
              This would be seen as an insult."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Take some time for consideration before agreeing to anything. 
              Quick decisiveness is often seen as hasty."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"A promise does not mean that your request will be carried out. 
              You should always ask for written confirmation of any agreement or 
              commitment."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Management or other important people may sometimes make 
              unreasonable or overly aggressive demands to demonstrate their 
              importance within or to their own group. Be aware of such hidden 
              agendas."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Personalize everything. Explain how all proposals will benefit 
              a Mexican's country, community, family and, most important, the 
              Mexican personally."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Deal-making almost never occurs over the phone (and rarely by 
              letter). Mexicans prefer to do business in person."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Your local contact person or representative is very important 
              and should be chosen very carefully. A low-level representative 
              will be taken as an affront by status-conscious Mexicans, who will 
              assume that you are not really serious."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"The status of your hotel accommodations, the quality of your 
              clothes and watch, and whether or not you arrive in a chauffeured 
              limousine or in a taxi, etc. will be critically appraised by your 
              Mexican counterparts."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Be persistent! Don't give up if you don't receive a response 
              to your phone calls or letters right away or if your meetings are 
              continually postponed or canceled. If you give up, your Mexican 
              counterparts might assume that you weren't serious in the first 
              place."
Mexico,Dining and Entertainment,"Business entertainment is very important and it is during 
              these events that personal relationships should be developed."
Mexico,Dining and Entertainment,Always keep both hands above the table.
Mexico,Dining and Entertainment,"Don't leave the table immediately after you are finished 
              eating."
Mexico,Dining and Entertainment,"Drinking to excess is frowned upon in Mexico, especially when 
              it's done by women. Customarily, only men propose toasts; foreign 
              women normally shouldn't offer toasts."
Mexico,Dining and Entertainment,"Don’t show up on time for a social engagement -- you will be 
              the only one who does, and will most likely be waiting for a very 
              long time (possibly hours)."
Mexico,Dining and Entertainment,"To reciprocate, invite your Mexican counterparts to dinner at 
              a nice restaurant (French or Italian are your best bets). Pay in 
              advance to avoid arguments about the bill."
Mexico,Dining and Entertainment,"Businesspeople are often invited to visit the home of their 
              Mexican counterparts. On your first visit to a Mexican home, it is 
              best to wear business attire unless specifically told otherwise."
Mexico,Dress,"Men should always wear a shirt and tie, except at casual 
              affairs. Both men and women should dress conservatively. 
              Recommended colors are navy and dark gray."
Mexico,Dress,Women should always wear make-up.
Mexico,Gifts,"While gift giving is not always a necessity when doing 
              business in Mexico, gifts are much appreciated. Suggested initial 
              gifts include non-personal items with your corporate logo."
Mexico,Gifts,"Flowers should always be given when visiting a Mexican home. 
              It's OK to have them sent beforehand, or to bring them with you. 
              If you have them sent, make sure that they arrive before you do."
Mexico,Helpful Hints,"Any attempt to speak Spanish is appreciated by your Mexican 
              counterparts and is seen as a gesture of goodwill. Demonstrating 
              knowledge and appreciation of Mexican culture wins friends."
Mexico,Helpful Hints,"Mexicans are very proud of their independence and have a very 
              strong sense of national identity and pride. Never compare the way 
              things are done in Mexico with the way they are done in the United 
              States."
Mexico,Helpful Hints,"Deadlines are often little more than (very) general target 
              dates."
Mexico,Helpful Hints,"Note differences in class and status in Mexico, for such 
              differences are important."
Mexico,Helpful Hints,"Little things count. Not saying good-bye, for example, may 
              well offend and adversely affect your relationship to a much 
              greater extent than it would in the United States."
Mexico,Especially for Women,"Women should prepare for some difficulty when doing business 
              in Mexico. Because some Mexican businessmen you encounter may not 
              have had many dealings with women in positions of authority, you 
              should demonstrate your competence, skill and authority."
Mexico,Especially for Women,"Talk and behavior considered sexist and inappropriate in the 
              United States may well have to be endured in Mexico."
Mexico,Especially for Women,"Mexican men, business colleagues included, will pay foreign 
              businesswomen many compliments and may even be flirtatious. 
              Graciously accept such banter -- it is usually done with the 
              utmost respect -- while firmly reminding your male Mexican 
              counterparts that you are a businesswoman."
Mexico,Especially for Women,"Foreign businesswomen should not invite Mexican businessmen to 
              dinner unless their spouses also come along. If invited out to 
              dinner or to socialize by a male Mexican colleague, a 
              businesswoman should make it clear that no opportunity for romance 
              exists. Appearances are important."

Netherlands,Meeting and Greeting,"Shake hands with everyone present -- men, women, and children 
              -- at business and social meetings. Shake hands again when 
              leaving. Introduce yourself if no one is present to introduce you. 
              The Dutch consider it rude not to identify yourself."

              ""Hello."" They also answer the telephone with their last name."
Netherlands,Meeting and Greeting,"It is considered impolite to shout a greeting. Wave if 
              greeting someone from a distance."
Netherlands,Body Language,"The Dutch are reserved and don't touch in public or display 
              anger or extreme exuberance."
Netherlands,Body Language,"The Dutch value privacy and seldom speak to strangers. It is 
              more likely that they will wait for you to make the first move. 
              Don't be afraid to do so."
Netherlands,Body Language,The Dutch expect eye contact while speaking with someone.
Netherlands,Body Language,"Moving your index finger around your ear means you have a 
              telephone call, not ""you're crazy."" The crazy sign is to tap the 
              center of your forehead with your index finger. This gesture is 
              very rude."
Netherlands,Corporate Culture,"The Dutch take punctuality for business meetings very 
              seriously and expect that you will do likewise; call with an 
              explanation if you are delayed."
Netherlands,Corporate Culture,"Lateness, missed appointments, postponements, changing the 
              time of an appointment or a late delivery deteriorates trust and 
              can ruin relationships."
Netherlands,Corporate Culture,"Exchange business cards during or after conversation. No set 
              ritual exists. Business cards in English are acceptable."

              are the most experienced and most successful traders in Europe."

              performance. One-upmanship is frowned upon."

              answers."
Netherlands,Corporate Culture,"The Dutch are conservative and forceful and can be stubborn 
              and tough negotiators. They are willing to innovate or experiment, 
              but with minimal risk."
Netherlands,Corporate Culture,"Companies are frugal and careful with money. Business is 
              profit-oriented with the bottom line being very important. 
              However, the Dutch are not obsessed with numbers."
Netherlands,Corporate Culture,"Strategy is cautious and pragmatic, usually involving 
              step-by-step plans. Preparations are made to improvise the plan, 
              if needed. Strategy is clear and communicated to all levels."
Netherlands,Corporate Culture,"In many companies the decision-making process is slow and 
              ponderous, involving wide consultation. Consensus is vital. The 
              Dutch will keep talking until all parties agree."
Netherlands,Corporate Culture,"Once decisions are made, implementation is fast and efficient."
Netherlands,Corporate Culture,"In the Netherlands, commitments are taken seriously and are 
              honored. Do not promise anything or make an offer you are not 
              planning to deliver on."
Netherlands,Dining and Entertainment,"To beckon a waiter or waitress, raise your hand, make eye 
              contact, and sayober (waiter) or mevrouw(waitress)."
Netherlands,Dining and Entertainment,"It is appropriate to discuss business during lunch. Business 
              breakfasts are not very common."
Netherlands,Dining and Entertainment,"Most business entertaining is done in restaurants, but the 
              Dutch do a fair amount of entertaining at home as well."
Netherlands,Dining and Entertainment,"The Dutch will make it clear that you are their guest if they 
              intend to pay the bill, otherwise expect to ""go Dutch"" and pay 
              your fair share. No one will be embarrassed at splitting the bill."
Netherlands,Dining and Entertainment,"Spouses are often included in a business dinner. Ask if your 
              host expects your spouse included in a business function. Business 
              is not generally discussed if spouses are present."
Netherlands,Dining and Entertainment,"Dutch manners are frank -- no-nonsense informality combined 
              with strict adherence to basic etiquette."
Netherlands,Dining and Entertainment,"Food does not play the major role in hospitality that it does 
              in many other cultures. It is not considered essential for making 
              someone feel welcome. Do not expect to be served a meal unless the 
              invitation specifically mentions a meal."
Netherlands,Dining and Entertainment,"Men should wait until all women are seated before they sit. 
              Allow the hostess to start eating and drinking before you eat."

              and pizza."
Netherlands,Dining and Entertainment,"To signify that you would like more food or that you are not 
              finished, cross your knife and fork in the middle of your plate in 
              an X."
Netherlands,Dining and Entertainment,"It is considered rude to leave the table during dinner (even 
              to go to the bathroom)."
Netherlands,Dining and Entertainment,"When finished eating, place your knife and fork side by side 
              at the 5:25 position on your plate."
Netherlands,Dining and Entertainment,"Parties may go very late. Plan to stay for an hour or so after 
              dinner."
Netherlands,Dining and Entertainment,"Do not ask for a tour of your host's home; it is considered 
              impolite."

              of business and government."

              shirt. When leaving an office, put your jacket back on."
Netherlands,Gifts,"Gifts are generally not given or expected at business 
              meetings."
Netherlands,Gifts,"Gifts are exchanged in business only once a close, personal 
              relationship has developed."
Netherlands,Gifts,"The Dutch find any form of ostentation a bit embarrassing. A 
              grand gesture of generosity will only make them uncomfortable. 
              Lavish displays of wealth are considered bad taste."
Netherlands,Gifts,"Give books, art objects, wine, liquor. Do not give knives."
Netherlands,Gifts,"When invited to someone's home, bring a small gift for the 
              hostess. Bring children a small gift or candy. Sending flowers 
              before or after the party is also appropriate."
Netherlands,Helpful Hints,"The Dutch avoid superlatives. Compliments are offered 
              sparingly, and to say that something is ""not bad"" is to praise it. 
              A person who never offers criticism is seen as either being 
              simple-minded or failing to tell the truth. A foreigner need not 
              worry too much about saying something the will hurt feelings. The 
              Dutch will argue, but seldom take offense."
Netherlands,Helpful Hints,Dutch humor is subtle rather than slapstick.
Netherlands,Helpful Hints,"The Dutch speak directly and use a lot of eye contact. To a 
              foreigner, them may appear abrupt, but it is just their manner of 
              communicating."
Netherlands,Helpful Hints,"Do not call the Netherlands ""Holland."" Holland is a region 
              within the Netherlands."

              or shaking hands."

              one of the lowest in Europe, and those who do work are generally 
              in lower paying jobs."
Netherlands,Especially for Women,"Many Dutch women see the struggle for equal opportunities as

              first and last name, i.e.Mr. John Lund."
Norway,Meeting and Greeting,"Norwegians do not use the phrases ""Pleased to meet you"" or 
              ""How are you?"" They find these to be surface formalities with no

Norway,Corporate Culture,"Norwegians take punctuality for business meetings very 
              seriously and expect that you will do likewise; call if you will 
              be more than five minutes late."
Norway,Corporate Culture,"Management style is similar to the participative management 
              style in the United States, and employees are asked opinions."
Norway,Corporate Culture,"Consensus is a high priority, but the boss makes the final 
              decisions."
Norway,Dining and Entertainment,"Norwegians insist on punctuality for social occasions. 7:00 
              p.m. means 7:00 p.m."
Norway,Dining and Entertainment,"Business lunches are to discuss business, but business dinners 
              are mostly social. Business can also be discussed, but allow the 
              host to open the discussion."
Norway,Dining and Entertainment,"For a formal toast, look into the eyes of the person being 
              toasted and give a slight nod, then saySkål. Before 
              putting your glass down, meet the other person's eyes and nod."

              honor tapping his glass with a knife and thanking the hostess on

              pants."
Norway,Gifts,"When invited to someone's home, always bring a small gift for 
              the hostess. Give: flowers, chocolates, wine, pastries, liquor

              only .05. One beer can put you over the limit."
Norway,Helpful Hints,"Sincerity is very important. Norwegians often consider 
              Americans too glib and too casual. Never invite someone to dinner 
              or suggest ""getting together"" without following with a sincere 
              invitation."
Norway,Helpful Hints,"Norwegians are very proud of their landscape. Take the time to

Paraguay,Meeting and Greeting,"Paraguayans kiss twice when meeting friends and family 
              members."

              and never prop them up on a piece of furniture."
Paraguay,Body Language,"A chin flick (rubbing your hand under your chin) means “I 
              don't know.”"
Paraguay,Corporate Culture,"Paraguayans may be late, but visitors are expected to be 
              punctual for business meetings. Business appointments often begin 
              10 to 20 minutes late."
Paraguay,Corporate Culture,"Connections are more important than expertise. Personal 
              relationships are more important than business relationships."
Paraguay,Corporate Culture,"Take time to make “small talk” with colleagues before the 
              meeting begins."
Paraguay,Corporate Culture,"Negotiating and decision making will probably proceed slowly. 
              Be patient."
Paraguay,Corporate Culture,"Face-to-face communication is vital to doing business in 
              Paraguay. You will only be able to go so far communicating by 
              phone or fax."
Paraguay,Corporate Culture,"Hire a local contact to represent you in the Paraguayan 
              business community."
Paraguay,Corporate Culture,"Send the same company representative to negotiate deals. A new 
              person will need to start from scratch."
Paraguay,Dining and Entertainment,"An 8:00 p.m. social engagement could begin at 9:00 or 9:30 
              p.m. Dinner is usually served around 10:00 p.m. and never earlier 
              than 9:00 p.m. Never invite anyone for a 7:00 p.m. dinner, which 
              would be far too early. Invite people at 8:30 or 9:00 p.m., and 
              serve dinner at 10:00 p.m."
Paraguay,Dining and Entertainment,"Lunch is the main meal of the day. Businesspeople and 
              schoolchildren go home at noon to have lunch with their family. It 
              may be followed by an hour-long nap before everyone returns to 
              work and school."
Paraguay,Dining and Entertainment,"Guests are served full plates of food. Show that you enjoy 
              your food. Eat dinner and accept seconds, which will probably be 
              pressed upon you. Not finishing all the food offered is a 
              compliment to your host."
Paraguay,Dining and Entertainment,"When dining continental style, it is customary to hold your 
              fork constantly in your left hand."
Paraguay,Dining and Entertainment,"Paraguayans share. They buy rounds of drink and offer food to 
              all."

              host initiates it."

              groomed and clean."
Paraguay,Dress,"Men should wear dark suits and ties for initial meetings. 
              Follow your Paraguayan counterparts' lead in dressing after the

Paraguay,Gifts,Give high quality gifts.
Paraguay,Gifts,Gifts from your country and home region will be appreciated.
Paraguay,Gifts,"Giving a knife suggests “cutting” the relationship. Including 
              a coin with the knife can blunt the “cutting.” This is an old 
              tradition."
Paraguay,Gifts,"Give your hostess flowers and chocolates. Sweets (cookies and 
              candies) from Argentina are prized by Paraguayans."
Paraguay,Gifts,"Gifts for children are appreciated. Barbie dolls and Power 
              Rangers are popular with young children, and older children will 
              appreciate t-shirts and baseball caps (Hard Rock Cafe, Nike, NBA, 
              Major League Baseball)."

              appreciate your interest in it."

Paraguay,Helpful Hints,"Do not photograph anything associated with the military, 
              including soldiers, bridges or equipment."

Philippines,Meeting and Greeting,"Men and women shake hands with everyone present at a business 
              meeting or social occasion and when saying ""goodbye."" Handshakes 
              should be friendly and informal, but limp. Men should wait for 
              women to extend their hand."
Philippines,Body Language,"If Filipinos don't understand a question, they open their 
              mouths. Raised eyebrows signify recognition and agreement."
Philippines,Body Language,"Laughter may convey pleasure or embarrassment; it is commonly 
              used to relieve tension."
Philippines,Body Language,"""Yes"" is signified by a jerk of the head upward. ""No"" is 
              signified by a jerk of the head down. Since the Filipinos rarely 
              say no, the non-verbal sign for ""no"" is sometimes accompanied by a 
              verbal yes, which would still indicate ""no."""
Philippines,Body Language,"Staring is considered rude and could be misinterpreted as a 
              challenge, but Filipinos may stare or even touch foreigners, 
              especially in areas where foreigners are rarely seen."
Philippines,Body Language,"To Filipinos, standing with your hands on your hips means you 
              are angry."
Philippines,Body Language,"Never curl your index finger back and forth (to beckon). This 
              is an insult."
Philippines,Body Language,"To indicate two of something, raise your ring and pinkie 
              fingers."
Philippines,Body Language,"To beckon, extend arm, palm down, moving fingers in scratching 
              motion. Touch someone's elbow lightly to attract attention. Do not 
              tap on the shoulder."
Philippines,Body Language,"""Eyebrow flash"" -- a quick lifting of eyebrows -- is a 
              Filipino greeting."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Filipinos are relaxed about time. Meetings and appointments 
              often begin late. Foreigners are supposed to be on time."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"A personal introduction by a mutual friend or business 
              associate makes business arrangements much smoother."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Establishing a personal relationship is important to the 
              success of a business relationship. Trust and loyalty are central 
              to developing relationships. Insincerity is easily detected and 
              can ruin the relationship."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Filipinos often have a ""take it or leave it"" attitude when it 
              comes to selling prices. They may also may place less stress on 
              the absolute selling price and place more emphasis on percentages, 
              unit cost or rounded figures."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Casual conversation may precede business discussions during 
              meetings."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Negotiations and business deals move slowly. A third-party 
              go-between may be a good idea to relieve tension or give 
              criticism. Do not allow meetings to go too long. Filipinos love to 
              eat and their enthusiasm wanes when they are hungry."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Communication is indirect, truth is diplomatically presented, 
              manner is gentle, and the perception of the recipient is 
              considered in all communications. All communication should be 
              courteous, regardless of its content. The Filipino attempt to 
              please may result in many unfinished projects."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Filipinos find it difficult to say ""no,"" disagree, reject or 
              be confrontational, especially when a superior is involved. Expect 
              an ambiguous or indirect answer -- not to deceive, but rather to 
              please and avoid confrontation."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Face-to-face meetings are preferred. Written communications 
              might not be answered. Communication by mail or telephone is 
              unreliable at best."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Small bribes are occasionally used to cut through 
              bureaucracies. This is illegal, but done quietly and often. 
              Participate with caution."
Philippines,Dining and Entertainment,"Most business entertaining is done in restaurants or clubs, 
              preferably a good restaurant in an international hotel. During 
              business entertaining, you may be asked to sing. Try to join in."
Philippines,Dining and Entertainment,"A dinner invitation to counterparts and their spouses is 
              appreciated before you leave the country. Don't bring your spouse 
              to a business lunch. Lunches are generally for business 
              discussions."
Philippines,Dining and Entertainment,"Filipinos may view a dinner/party invitation as just a passing 
              thought. They may answer ""yes,"" but not take an invitation 
              seriously. Phone to re-invite and remind. An R.S.V.P. may not be 
              answered. It must be reiterated to be taken seriously. Don't 
              accept an invitation unless repeated at least three times."
Philippines,Dining and Entertainment,"People who have not been invited may turn up at dinner. They 
              should be included graciously."
Philippines,Dining and Entertainment,"Punctuality is appreciated but not demanded when attending 
              social affairs."
Philippines,Dining and Entertainment,Getting drunk is considered greedy and rude.
Philippines,Dining and Entertainment,"Toasts are common in the Philippines, especially at business 
              meetings. Usually the host or lead of the visiting party initiates 
              a toast."
Philippines,Dining and Entertainment,"It is polite to decline the first offer of seating, food, 
              drink, etc. Accept the second offer."
Philippines,Dining and Entertainment,Keep your hands above the table during dinner.
Philippines,Dining and Entertainment,"Leave a small amount of food on your plate when you are 
              finished eating. When finished eating, place your fork and spoon 
              on your plate."
Philippines,Dining and Entertainment,The person who invites pays the bill.
Philippines,Dress,"Filipinos are some of the smartest dressers in Asia. Dress 
              well for most occasions."
Philippines,Dress,Men should wear a jacket and tie for initial meetings.
Philippines,Dress,"Women should wear western dresses, skirts and blouses."
Philippines,Gifts,"Gifts are not expected, but are appreciated. You may want to 
              bring a small gift to your first meeting."
Philippines,Gifts,"Gifts are not opened in the giver's presence. Thank the giver 
              and set it aside."
Philippines,Helpful Hints,"Speak softly and control your emotions in public. Make 
              requests, not demands."
Philippines,Helpful Hints,"Don't be offended by personal questions. These are asked to 
              show interest. Feel free to ask the same questions in return, 
              especially about family."
Philippines,Helpful Hints,Verbal assault is a crime for which you can be charged.
Philippines,Helpful Hints,"Never bring shame to a person. This reflects on his family. 
              Personal goals are sacrificed for the good of the family."
Philippines,Helpful Hints,"Never directly criticize anyone, especially in public. Never 
              offer insincere comments or compliments."
Philippines,Especially for Women,"Foreign women will have little problem doing business in the 
              Philippines."
Philippines,Especially for Women,"Men may make comments about women walking on the street. These 
              should be ignored."
Philippines,Especially for Women,"A foreign woman should not pay a bill for a Filipino 
              businessman. It would embarrass him and might harm the business 
              relationship."

              particularly seriously, but expect that you will be on time. Call

              Portuguese counterparts to be 15-30 minutes late."

              if you have correspondence translated into Portuguese."
Portugal,Corporate Culture,Plan on hiring an interpreter for business meetings.
Portugal,Corporate Culture,"Meetings are for briefing or discussion. Decisions may take 
              several meetings. Do not expect clear, decisive results. The aim 
              is not to find a common ground, but to strongly express one's 
              point of view."
Portugal,Corporate Culture,"If agreement/support is required at a meeting, you should 
              lobby participants privately beforehand."
Portugal,Dining and Entertainment,"Food is served family style. The guest of honor serves 
              him/herself first and passes dishes around the table."
Portugal,Dining and Entertainment,Fish is eaten with a special knife and fork.
Portugal,Dining and Entertainment,"To signify that you would like more food, place you fork 
              diagonal from the left and your knife straight down to form a 
              triangular position. When finished eating, place knife and fork 
              (tines up) side by side on your plate at the 5:25 position."
Portugal,Dining and Entertainment,"It is polite to leave some food on your plate when finished 
              eating."

              alcohol), accept."

              life."

Portugal,Helpful Hints,"Portugal is not part of Spain, and the people are not Spanish, 
              nor are they in any way similar to the Spanish in culture. They do 
              not speak Spanish or Brazilian."
Portugal,Helpful Hints,Keep a relaxed attitude about time.
Portugal,Especially for Women,Foreign business women are treated fairly and with respect.
Portugal,Especially for Women,"Traditionally, conservative attitudes have prevailed towards 
              women, but there is a strong movement towards Portuguese women 
              being involved in business."
Portugal,Especially for Women,"Going to a bar alone is frowned upon. It may call unwelcome 
              attention."
Portugal,Especially for Women,"It is better for a foreign woman to invite a Portuguese man to 
              a business lunch rather than dinner. If you invite a man to 
              dinner, it is better to ask if he would like to bring his wife."
Portugal,Especially for Women,"The charm of Portuguese men will not allow a woman to pay for 
              a lunch or dinner. It is acceptable to try."

Russia,Meeting and Greeting,"Initial greetings may come across as cool. Do not expect 
              friendly smiles."
Russia,Meeting and Greeting,"A handshake is always appropriate (but not obligatory) when 
              greeting or leaving, regardless of the relationship. Remove your 
              gloves before shaking hands. Don't shake hands over a threshold 
              (Russian folk belief holds that this action will lead to an 
              argument)."
Russia,Body Language,"Russians are a very demonstrative people, and public physical 
              contact is common. Hugs, backslapping, kisses on the cheeks and 
              other expansive gestures are common among friends or acquaintances 
              and between members of the same sex."
Russia,Body Language,Russians stand close when talking.
Russia,Body Language,"Putting your thumb through your index and middle fingers or 
              making the ""OK"" sign are considered very rude gestures in Russia."
Russia,Corporate Culture,"Russians appreciate punctuality. Business meetings generally 
              begin on time."
Russia,Corporate Culture,"Under Communism there were no incentives for bureaucrats to 
              perform well or to even be pleasant toward clients; this meant 
              that the usual answer to any question was ""No."" This practice is 
              still found in Russian society today, but ""No"" is usually not the 
              final word on an issue. One has to bargain and be persistent to 
              get what he or she wants."
Russia,Corporate Culture,"Business cards are handed out liberally in Russia and are 
              always exchanged at business meetings. The ceremony of presenting 
              and receiving business cards is important. Don't treat it lightly."
Russia,Corporate Culture,"Representatives of the Russian company or government body are 
              usually seated on one side of a table at meetings with guests on 
              the other side."
Russia,Corporate Culture,"Your company should be represented by a specialized team of 
              experts. Presentations should be thoroughly prepared, detailed, 
              factual and short on ""salesmanship."""
Russia,Corporate Culture,"Russians usually negotiate technical issues very competently, 
              directly and clearly but, being newcomers to capitalism, often do 
              not fully understand Western business practices and objectives. 
              You may have to explain the reasoning behind some of your demands."
Russia,Corporate Culture,"Russians find it difficult to admit mistakes, especially 
              publicly. They also find it difficult to risk offending someone by 
              making requests or assertions."
Russia,Corporate Culture,"Trying to do business in Russia over the telephone is 
              generally ineffective. The Russian telecommunications system is 
              inadequate, but improving quickly. The telex is widely used."
Russia,Corporate Culture,"Personal relationships play a crucial role in Russian 
              business."

              patience. Plan to be in for the long haul."

Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"When dining in a restaurant, arrive on time."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"Russians are great hosts and love entertaining guests in their 
              homes. They will often put more food on the table than can be 
              eaten to indicate there is an abundance of food (whether there is 
              or not). Guests who leave food on their plates honor their host. 
              It means they have eaten well."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"If you're invited for dinner, don't make other plans for later 
              in the evening. You are expected to spend time socializing after 
              the meal."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"An invitation to a Russian dacha (country home) is a great 
              honor."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"Do not turn down offers of food or drink. Given Russian 
              hospitality, this can be difficult, but to decline such offers is 
              considered rude."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"At formal functions, guests do not usually start eating until 
              the host has begun. At such functions, no one should leave until 
              the guest of honor has left. If you are the guest of honor, do not 
              stay too late."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"Know your limits when drinking alcohol in Russia. Drinking is 
              often an all-or-nothing affair -- moderation is not understood."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"Toasts, which are sometimes lengthy and occasionally humorous, 
              are common. The host starts and the guests reply. Do not drink 
              until the first toast has been offered."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"After a toast, most Russians like to clink their glasses 
              together. Do not do so if you are drinking something 
              non-alcoholic."
Russia,Dress,"A ""serious"" businessperson is expected to look formal and 
              conservative. Wearing very light or bright colors might make you 
              appear lazy or unreliable to a Russian."
Russia,Dress,"Men should wear suits and ties. Women should wear suits and 
              dresses or pantsuits."
Russia,Gifts,"A small business gift is always appropriate, but its value 
              should correspond to the rank of the Russian businessperson with 
              whom you are meeting."
Russia,Gifts,"As a general rule, do not give items that are now easily 
              obtainable in Russia."
Russia,Gifts,"Bring a gift for the hostess when visiting a Russian home. A 
              small gift for a Russian child is always appropriate (and 
              appreciated)."
Russia,Helpful Hints,"Russians are very proud of their culture and enjoy 
              opportunities to talk about their music, art, literature and 
              dance. Knowledge about art, music and some Russian history is 
              appreciated."
Russia,Helpful Hints,"Learn Russian! Learning the language is of incalculable value, 
              and is the best way to win friends for yourself, your company and 
              your country. If that simply isn't possible, try to learn at least 
              a few phrases in Russian. It doesn't have to be perfect; Russians 
              greatly appreciate any attempt by foreigners to speak their 
              language."
Russia,Helpful Hints,"Never refer to a Russian as ""Comrade."""
Russia,Helpful Hints,"Do not expect to find smoke-free areas anywhere. A standard 
              joke among foreign businesspeople in Russia is that Russian 
              buildings have two sections: ""smoking"" and ""chain-smoking."""
Russia,Especially for Women,"Women are initially regarded with skepticism and may have to 
              prove themselves. Before you visit, have a mutually respected

              should clearly state your title and academic degree. If you 
              establish your position and ability immediately, you will 
              encounter far fewer problems."
Russia,Especially for Women,"Be feminine. Allow men to open doors, light cigarettes, etc. 
              Even if you think such customs are antiquated or silly, respect 
              the cultural background of your Russian colleagues."
Russia,Especially for Women,"Foreign businesswomen can use their femininity to their 
              advantage. For fear of not appearing a gentleman, many Russian 
              businessmen may allow foreign businesswomen to get away with some 
              things (requests for meetings, favors, etc.) that foreign 
              businessmen aren't allowed."
Russia,Especially for Women,"A woman can invite a Russian businessman to lunch and pay the 
              bill, although it might be interpreted by some men as an 
              invitation to flirt."

Singapore,Meeting and Greeting,"Shake hands with everyone present at a business meeting or 
              social occasion. Shake hands again when leaving. Your handshake 
              should be firm."
Singapore,Meeting and Greeting,"Singaporeans may bow slightly as they shake your hand. Many 
              Westerners are generally taller than Singaporeans, so it would be 
              polite to give a small bow. A slight bow for Chinese or older 
              people is polite."
Singapore,Body Language,"Never touch a person's or child's head. The head is considered 
              sacred."
Singapore,Body Language,"The foot is considered the lowest part of the body, and is 
              thought to be unclean. The foot should never be used to point at 
              someone, and you should never show the bottom of your feet. 
              Tapping your foot or fidgeting your legs denotes feebleness and 
              lack of interest. When crossing your legs, do so only by placing 
              one knee over the other."
Singapore,Body Language,"Raise your hand to get someone's attention. Never signal or 
              point at a person with the forefinger. Do not pound your first on 
              an open palm; this is obscene. The forearm jerk is a rude gesture."
Singapore,Corporate Culture,"Westerners are expected to be punctual for social occasions 
              and business meetings. Call if you are delayed. Tardiness is 
              viewed as a sign of disrespect."

              business cards with both hands after you are introduced."
Singapore,Corporate Culture,"The government finances many of the large corporations in 
              Singapore. This bureaucratic system is known for its high 
              efficiency and corruption-free business style. Western-style 
              management is evident in large firms managed by Singaporeans."
Singapore,Corporate Culture,"Personal contacts are important in business. It takes several 
              years to develop business relationships. Take time to know people 
              before discussing business."

Singapore,Dining and Entertainment,"Dinner is the most common form of business entertainment, but 
              it is a time to socialize and build relationships rather than 
              discuss business. Don't be surprised if business dinners are 
              scheduled for every night of the week. Most entertainment is done 
              in restaurants."
Singapore,Dining and Entertainment,"Food is usually put on the table with all dishes served at 
              once and to be shared by all. Drinks and appetizers are uncommon, 
              though they are available in Western restaurants."

              reciprocate with a banquet of equal value before departing."
Singapore,Dining and Entertainment,"Chinese use chopsticks for most food and porcelain spoons for 
              the liquid part of soup. Western style utensils are used, but are 
              not as common as chopsticks."
Singapore,Dining and Entertainment,"Allow a Chinese host to invite you to start your meal and 
              begin eating before you start to eat."

              served immediately with no drinks or appetizers beforehand."

Singapore,Dining and Entertainment,"Malays and Indians use a spoon along with their hands to eat, 
              but never use your left hand to eat (unclean). If given a spoon 
              and fork, hold the spoon in your right hand and use your fork 
              (left hand) to push food onto the spoon."
Singapore,Dining and Entertainment,"Never let the serving spoon touch your plate and never share 
              your leftovers. Indians believe that anything that touches 
              someone's plate is tainted."
Singapore,Dining and Entertainment,"It is impolite to refuse initial offers of food or drink. To 
              refuse seconds, place your hand above your plate and say, ""No, 
              thank you."" When finished, place your spoon and fork together on 
              your plate. If they are not placed together, you will be offered

              one hour of conversation."

Singapore,Gifts,"Be careful of the gift being misinterpreted as a bribe, even a 
              small gift. Never give a government official a gift, which might

South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"The bow is the traditional Korean greeting, although it is 
              often accompanied by a handshake among men. To show respect when 
              shaking hands, support your right forearm with your left hand."
South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"Korean women usually nod slightly and will not shake hands 
              with Western men. Western women may offer their hand to a Korean 
              man."
South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"Bow when departing. Younger people wave (move their arm from 
              side to side)."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"It is considered very impolite to address a Korean with his or 
              her given name. Address Koreans using appropriate professional 
              titles until specifically invited by your host or colleagues to 
              use their given names."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Americans should address a Korean with Mr., Mrs., Miss + 
              family name; however, never address a high-ranking person or 
              superior in this manner."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Korean names are the opposite of Western names with the family 
              name first, followed by the two-part given name. The first of the 
              two given names is shared by everyone of the same generation in 
              the family, and the second is the individual's given name. 
              Example: Lee (Family) + Dong (Shared Given) + Sung (Given). Dong 
              Sung is the individual's given name. Address him as Mr. Lee or Lee 
              Sonsaengnim (which means ""teacher"")."
South Korea,Body Language,"Koreans consider it a personal violation to be touched by 
              someone who is not a relative or close friend. Avoid touching, 
              patting or back slapping a Korean."
South Korea,Body Language,"Direct eye contact between junior and senior businesspeople 
              should be avoided. This is seen as impolite or even as a 
              challenge."
South Korea,Body Language,"Do not cross your legs or stretch your legs out straight in 
              front of you. Keep your feet on the floor, never on a desk or 
              chair."
South Korea,Body Language,"Always pass and receive objects with your right hand 
              (supported by the left hand at the wrist or forearm) or with two 
              hands."
South Korea,Body Language,"To beckon someone, extend your arm, palm down, and move your 
              fingers in a scratching motion. Never point with your index 
              finger."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Koreans expect Westerners to be punctual for social occasions 
              and business meetings. Call if you will be delayed. However, you 
              may be kept waiting up to a half hour. This is not a sign of 
              disrespect, but reflects the pressure of time on Korean 
              executives."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Professionals meeting for the first time usually exchange 
              business cards. Present your card and receive your colleague's 
              card with both hands."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Building trust and relationships is vital to establishing a 
              successful business relationship. This requires patience. Koreans 
              prefer to do business with people they know."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"The first meeting is to establish trust, so business should 
              not be discussed. Be formal in meetings until the Korean 
              delegation loosens up."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Negotiations are generally long and require several trips. Be 
              prepared for business meetings to go well beyond business hours."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Koreans generally start negotiations at an unreasonable 
              position and prepare to compromise. Koreans are tough negotiators 
              and admire a firm, persistent negotiator, but refrain from being 
              too aggressive."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"A low, deep bow from Koreans at the end of a meeting indicates 
              a successful meeting. A quick, short parting bow could mean 
              dissatisfaction with meetings. Send a meeting review outlining all 
              discussions and agreements to your Korean counterpart after you 
              leave Korea. Make several visits during negotiations and after 
              business is established."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"""Yes"" is not necessarily “yes.” Koreans avoid saying ""no."" Try 
              to phrase questions in a manner that doesn't require a ""yes"" or 
              ""no"" answer. Example: Instead of saying ""Could we sign the 
              agreement by next Friday?” say ""When is the earliest date that we 
              could expect to sign this agreement?"""
South Korea,Dining and Entertainment,"Sharing a dinner is vital to building friendships that foster 
              trust. Your business success is directly related to your social 
              relationships."
South Korea,Dining and Entertainment,"Do not pour your own drink, but do offer to pour others'. It 
              is common to trade and fill each other's cup. To refuse is an 
              insult. Women pour men's drinks, but never another woman's drink. 
              A woman may pour her own drink. Leave some drink in your glass if 
              you don't want a refill."
South Korea,Dining and Entertainment,"Wherever you see a ""No Tipping"" sign, do not tip. Koreans find 
              tipping offensive, although tipping is now becoming expected in 
              Western hotels."
South Korea,Dining and Entertainment,"Always allow your host to seat you. The seat of honor is the 
              seat looking at the front door. If you are seated in the seat of 
              honor, it is polite to protest slightly."
South Korea,Dining and Entertainment,"Koreans do not like to talk a lot during dinner. Periods of 
              silence are common and appreciated at a dinner. The meal usually 
              comes before socializing at a dinner party."
South Korea,Dining and Entertainment,"It is polite to pass or accept food or drink with your right 
              hand while your left hand supports your forearm/wrist."
South Korea,Dining and Entertainment,"The person who invites pays the bill for everyone. However, it 
              is polite to offer to pay. When two people are dining, usually the 
              younger person pays for the older person."
South Korea,Dining and Entertainment,"Prepare to sing a solo number after dinner, no matter what 
              kind of voice you have. Any song is acceptable, as long as you 
              sing with spirit."
South Korea,Dining and Entertainment,"After dinner, the host may invite his guests to go drinking. 
              Don't refuse this invitation."
South Korea,Dress,"Koreans dress well, and you should dress accordingly to show 
              respect for them. A formal suit and tie is almost always 
              appropriate. Koreans dress up for city activities, especially in 
              Seoul."
South Korea,Dress,"Women dress modestly. Prepare to sit on the floor; avoid 
              straight, tight skirts."
South Korea,Gifts,"Gift giving is very common in Korea. Offer and receive a gift 
              with both hands. Wrapped gifts are never opened in the presence of 
              the giver."
South Korea,Gifts,"Reciprocate with a gift of similar value when receiving a gift 
              from your Korean colleague. Koreans like regional United States 
              gifts and Indian/Western artifacts."
South Korea,Gifts,"Wrap your gift nicely. Bright colors are preferred for 
              wrapping gifts. Yellow and red or green stripes are a traditional 
              Korean wrapping paper design. Avoid wrapping gifts in dark colors 
              or red."
South Korea,Gifts,"Always bring a small gift for the hostess when invited to

South Korea,Gifts,"Do not give: expensive gifts (Koreans will feel obligated to 
              reciprocate with a gift of equal value), knives or scissors (they 
              signify ""cutting off"" a relationship), green headwear, gifts with 
              red writing (denotes death) or gifts in a set of four (denotes 
              death)."
South Korea,Helpful Hints,"Never use words like ""fellow,"" ""guy,"" ""this man"" or ""that 
              man."" This is considered demeaning."
South Korea,Helpful Hints,"Koreans are not Chinese. They are distinct from other Asians 
              in food, language and culture."
South Korea,Helpful Hints,"Expect Koreans to ask personal questions. This is viewed as 
              showing a polite interest in your life."

              shows a lack of humility."
South Korea,Helpful Hints,"Never expect Koreans to admit to not knowing an answer when 
              questioned. They may give an incorrect answer or an answer they 
              think you would like to hear to make you feel good or to save 
              face."
South Korea,Helpful Hints,"Don't talk about Koreans or their customs or culture within 
              earshot of a Korean, even if you are saying good things. Do not 
              talk about politics."
South Korea,Especially for Women,"Foreign women may have difficulty doing business in Korea. 
              Although women are becoming more accepted in the Korean 
              businessplace, Korean men generally prefer to negotiate with men."

              very ""feminine.” Laughing and loud talking are frowned upon."

Spain,Corporate Culture,"Spaniards will want to spend time getting to know you and

Spain,Corporate Culture,"Typically, Spanish is the language of business, but most large 
              companies conduct business in English and Spanish. You cannot

Thailand,Meeting and Greeting,"When being introduced or greeting someone, men say 
              Sawatdee-krap and women say Sawatdee-kah."
Thailand,Meeting and Greeting,"Thais greet each other with a ""wai."" Foreigners are not 
              expected to initiate the wai gesture, but it is an insult not to 
              return the wai. If a wai is not offered to you, shake hands with 
              men and smile and nod to women. A Thai businessperson may shake 
              hands with a foreigner. Offer a wai only to a person of equal or 
              greater status. Subordinates should offer a wai first."
Thailand,Meeting and Greeting,"Wai (why) - a person places the palm of his or her hands 
              together, with their fingers extended at chest level close to 
              their body and bows slightly. The higher the hands are placed, the 
              more respect is shown. Subordinates might raise their fingers as 
              high as their nose. However, the tips of their fingers should 
              never be above eye level."
Thailand,Meeting and Greeting,"A wai can mean ""Hello,"" ""Thank you,"" ""I'm sorry,"" or 
              ""Goodbye."" A wai is not used to greet children, servants, street 
              vendors or laborers. Never return a wai to a child, waiter, clerk, 
              etc. Simply nod and smile in response."

Thailand,Meeting and Greeting,"Thais say ""Where are you going"" rather than ""Hello."" A polite 
              response is ""Just down the street."""
Thailand,Meeting and Greeting,"Introductions are common only in a formal situation. Introduce 
              yourself by your first name. Feel free to introduce yourself or 
              ask for someone's name. When introducing your business partner to 
              an important Thai, mention your partner's name first."
Thailand,Meeting and Greeting,"The inferior or lower-status person is always addressed first 
              in an introduction. Thus, a child is introduced before its 
              parents, a secretary is introduced before her boss."
Thailand,Names and Titles,"Thais address one another by first names and titles and 
              reserve last names for very formal occasions and written 
              communications. Last names have been used in Thailand for only the 
              past fifty years and are difficult even for Thais to pronounce. 
              Two people with the same last name are almost certainly related."
Thailand,Names and Titles,"Foreigners are often addressed by their given names because it

              are you?"" or ""How are you doing?"" are ""Fine,"" ""Great,"" or ""Very 
              well, thank you."" This is not a request for information about your 
              well-being; it is simply a pleasantry."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"""See you later"" is just an expression. People say this even if 
              they never plan to see you again."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"When saying good-bye, Americans may say ""We'll have to get 
              together"" or ""Let's do lunch."" This is simply a friendly gesture. 
              Unless your American colleague specifies a time and date, don't 
              expect an invitation. If you want to have lunch, you should take 
              the initiative to schedule it."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Stand while being introduced. Only the elderly, the ill and 
              physically unable persons remain seated while greeting or being 
              introduced."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"It is good to include some information about a person you are 
              introducing. Example: ""Susan Olson, I'd like you to meet John 
              Harmon. He designed the brochure we are using for this campaign."""
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Use professional titles when you are introducing people to 
              each other. Example: ""Judge Susan Olson, meet Dr. John Harmon."" If 
              you are introducing yourself, do not use your professional title."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Handshakes are usually brief. Light handshakes are considered 
              distasteful. Use a firm grip."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,Eye contact is important when shaking someone’s hand.
United States,Body Language,"Keep your distance when conversing. If an American feels you 
              are standing too close, he or she may step back without even 
              thinking about it."
United States,Body Language,"People who like to touch really like touching, and people who 
              do not like to touch really dislike being touched. You will need 
              to watch your colleagues for clues on what they are comfortable 
              with."
United States,Body Language,"Americans are generally uncomfortable with same-sex touching, 
              especially between males."
United States,Body Language,"Holding the middle finger up by itself is considered insulting 
              and vulgar."
United States,Body Language,"Americans smile a great deal, even at strangers. They like to 
              have their smiles returned."
United States,Body Language,"Men and women will sit with legs crossed at the ankles or 
              knees, or one ankle crossed on the knee."
United States,Body Language,"Some Americans are known as ""back slappers"" -- they give 
              others a light slap on the back to show friendship."
United States,Corporate Culture,"In a country that prides itself on its individualism, companies 
            are organized and structured with many different styles depending on 
            the industry, the company's history and its current leaders. In the 
            United States, business relationships are formed between companies 
            rather than between people. Americans do business where they get the 
            best deal and the best service. It is not important to develop a 
            personal relationship in order to establish a long and successful 
            business relationship."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans view the business card as a source of future 
              information and tend to exchange cards casually. There is no set 
              ritual for exchanging business cards."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans prefer directness in communication. When Americans 
              say ""yes"" or ""no,"" they mean precisely that. ""Maybe"" really does 
              mean ""it might happen""; it does not mean ""no."""
United States,Corporate Culture,"It is always proper to ask questions if you do not understand 
              something. Americans ask questions -- lots of them. They are not 
              ashamed to admit what they do know. Americans will assume you 
              understand something if you do not tell them otherwise."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans are often uncomfortable with silence. Silence is 
              avoided in social or business meetings."
United States,Corporate Culture,"It is rude to interrupt someone who is talking. Say, ""Excuse 
              me"" during a pause and wait to be recognized. Interruptions, 
              however, are common. Do not be surprised if someone finishes your 
              sentence if you hesitate when you are speaking."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans put a great deal of value on the written word. 
              American law almost always requires contracts to be written out. 
              Verbal contracts are rarely legally binding. Make sure you read 
              the fine print."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Do not enter into any contract without hiring a lawyer. No 
              savvy American businessperson would dream of signing a contract 
              before consulting a lawyer."
United States,Corporate Culture,"It is very important in written communication to spell names 
              correctly and have correct titles. If you are unsure of these, 
              call the person's assistant to get the correct spelling and title."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Keep appointments once they are made. You may not get a second 
              chance if you do not."
United States,Corporate Culture,"When you are doing business in the United States, you must be 
              on time. Americans view someone being late as rude, showing a lack 
              of respect and having sloppy, undisciplined personal habits."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Being ""on time"" in business situations generally means being 
              about five minutes early. Five minutes late is acceptable with a 
              brief apology. Ten to fifteen minutes late requires a phone call 
              to warn of the delay and to apologize."
United States,Corporate Culture,"It is very important to meet deadlines. If you tell someone 
              that you will have a report to them by a certain date, or that you 
              will fax something to them immediately, they will take you at your 
              word. People who miss deadlines are viewed as irresponsible and 
              undependable."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Meetings are generally informal and relaxed in manner, but 
              serious in content. Often an agenda will be distributed before a 
              meeting, so the participants will be prepared to discuss certain 
              topics. A successful meeting is short and to the point. Be 
              prepared to begin business immediately, with little or no prior 
              small talk."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Participation is expected in meetings. A quiet person may be 
              viewed as not prepared or as having nothing important to 
              contribute."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Meetings often end with a summary and an action plan for the 
              participants to execute. A meeting is only considered successful 
              if something concrete is decided."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans appreciate and are impressed by numbers. Using 
              statistics to support your opinions will help you be persuasive."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Generally, there is one negotiation leader who has the 
              authority to make decisions. Team negotiations are rare. Americans 
              may begin negotiations with unacceptable conditions or demands. 
              They are usually taking a starting position that gives them room 
              to bargain."
United States,Corporate Culture,"The goal of most negotiations in the United States is to 
              arrive at a signed contract. Long-term relationships and benefits 
              may not be the main objective. The immediate deal may be the only 
              important issue."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Negotiations may seem rushed to you. Remember that ""time is 
              money"" to Americans and that they may not think that building a 
              relationship with potential business partners is necessary."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans are very comfortable picking up the telephone and 
              immediately conducting business with someone they have never met 
              and perhaps never will meet."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"Americans conduct business over breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
              Some socializing may start off the meal, but often the 
              conversation will revolve around business."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"In a business setting the person extending the invitation to a 
              meal pays for it."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"The fork is held in the left hand, tines facing down. The 
              knife is held in the right hand. After cutting the food, the knife 
              is laid down and the fork is switched to the right hand to eat the 
              cut food. Continental style (where the fork stays in the left hand 
              to eat the cut food) is perfectly acceptable."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"The guest of honor is often toasted and should reciprocate by 
              giving a toast of thanks."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"Your napkin should be placed on your lap shortly after you are 
              seated and kept on your lap at all times during the meal. Do not 
              tuck your napkin under your chin."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"Raise your hand or index finger and make eye contact to signal 
              a server."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,Dinner at an American home may be fairly informal.
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"Do not be late for a dinner party. Arrive within 5 to 15 
              minutes after the time on the invitation. Never arrive before the 
              time you were invited. If you are going to be more than 15 minutes 
              late, phone your hosts and apologize."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"Never begin eating until everyone is served and your hosts 
              have begun. Offer food or drink to others before helping yourself. 
              Serve all women at the table first."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"If offered a second helping of food, feel free to take what 
              you like. Americans like people to eat a lot."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"When you are invited to an event, it is very important to call 
              or drop a note letting the host know if you will attend. That 
              said, Americans are notorious for not responding to invitations."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"Do not be afraid of hurting someone's feelings by responding 
              ""no"" to an invitation. People will be offended if you say you will 
              attend and then do not come."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"If an invitation reads ""6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.,"" leave very 
              close to the ending time stated."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"Americans tend to eat more quickly than people from other 
              countries. Dining in the United States is seldom the long, 
              lingering event it is in much of the world. The point is more 
              often to eat rather than socialize and savor the meal."
United States,Dress,"The appropriate clothing for business varies widely. Proper dress 
            depends on the region of the country, a person's company, his or her 
            position within it and the industry in which he or she works. The 
            best approach is to be conservative until you have had a chance to 
            observe what others wear in an office. You can always get more 
            casual after you get a sense of how people dress. You cannot lose, 
            however, if you begin with a very professional attire and manner."
United States,Dress,"Men: socks should match your suit. No leg should show between 
              pant hem and shoe. Remove your hat when indoors."
United States,Dress,"Women: do not overdress for daytime or wear flashy or noisy 
              jewelry. American women do not wear a lot of makeup to the office. 
              Low-cut blouses, short skirts and tight clothing are not 
              appropriate office attire."
United States,Gifts,"Americans do not have as many customs and taboos concerning 
              gifts as many other cultures have."
United States,Gifts,"Gifts from your country will always be appreciated. Good 
              choices are local and regional arts and crafts, books, candies, 
              specialty foods and wine or spirits (if you are certain that the 
              recipient drinks)."
United States,Gifts,"If you are invited to someone's home for dinner or a party, 
              bring flowers, a potted plant, a fruit basket, candy, wine, a book 
              or a small household gift."
United States,Gifts,"Many companies have policies that discourage their employees 
              from giving or receiving gifts. Most government employees are not 
              allowed to accept gifts. Do not be offended if someone cannot 
              accept a gift."
United States,Gifts,Cash gifts are never appropriate.
United States,Helpful Hints,"It is considered rude to stare, ask questions or otherwise 
              bring attention to someone's disability."
United States,Helpful Hints,"Smoking is very unpopular in the United States. Restaurants 
              have separate smoking and nonsmoking sections. Public and private 
              buildings may ban smoking except in designated areas. Some people 
              do not allow smoking in their homes and will ask you to go outside 
              if you want to have a cigarette. Never smoke anywhere without 
              asking permission from everyone present."
United States,Helpful Hints,"Names are not held as sacred in the United States. Someone may 
              mispronounce your name and laugh a bit as they do it. Or someone 
              may just call you by your given name if your family name is too 
              difficult to pronounce."
United States,Helpful Hints,"There are several common names and nicknames that are used by 
              both men and women. Call the person's assistant to ask if you are 
              unsure of his or her gender."
United States,Helpful Hints,"""Please"" and ""thank you"" are very important in the United 
              States. Say ""please"" and ""thank you"" to everyone for even the 
              smallest kindness. Americans say them regardless of rank or how 
              much they are paying for something, and they expect others to do 
              the same."
United States,Helpful Hints,"Say ""Pardon me"" or ""Excuse me"" if you touch someone or even 
              get close to someone. Americans also say this if they sneeze or 
              cough or do not understand something someone has said."
United States,Helpful Hints,"Americans often share things in casual conversation, even with 
              strangers, that may seem shockingly private."
United States,Helpful Hints,"Social conversation in the United States is light. There is a 
              standard format for small talk. People ask brief questions and 
              expect brief answers. Americans become uncomfortable when one 
              person talks for any length of time in a social situation."
United States,Helpful Hints,"If you feel uncomfortable with a question asked of you, simply 
              smile and say, ""In my country, that would be a strange question."""
United States,American Women,"Women are leaders in all aspects of American life from 
              business to education to government. Never assume that a working 
              woman is in a subordinate position."
United States,American Women,"American women are independent. They will not appreciate any 
              ""special help"" offered because of their gender. Do not assume that 
              a woman needs more time or more help than a man doing the same 
              job."
United States,American Women,"American women pride themselves on the number of 
              responsibilities they take on. Do not assume that a working woman 
              is no longer the primary caretaker of her family and children."
United States,American Women,"When addressing a woman, use the title ""Ms."" unless you know 
              that she prefers ""Mrs."" or ""Miss."""
United States,American Women,"Many women keep their maiden names after marriage. Some use 
              both their maiden and married names."
United States,American Women,"When going to dinner or lunch, the person who invites pays, 
              whether it is a man or a woman."
United States,American Women,"Do not touch a woman in a business setting except to shake her 
              hand. Hugging and kissing, even of people you know very well, is 
              best left for social occasions."

Venezuela,Gifts,"Do not give gifts in business until a personal relationship 
              has been established."
Venezuela,Helpful Hints,"Learn about Venezuelan history, and ask questions. Venezuelans 
              are proud of their country and will appreciate your interest. 
              However, don't talk about local unrest and inflation, or give your 
              opinion on local politics."
Venezuela,Helpful Hints,"People call each other names like Negro (“black”), Gordo 
              (“fatso”), Chino (“Chinaman”), etc. These nicknames are meant to 
              show friendship, fondness and fun and are not meant to be 
              demeaning."
Venezuela,Helpful Hints,Privacy is not valued in the same way it is in North America.

Vietnam,Meeting and Greeting,"The Vietnamese generally shake hands both when greeting and 
              when saying good-bye. Shake with both hands, and bow your head 
              slightly to show respect. Bow to the elderly who do not extend 
              their hand. Vietnamese women are more inclined to bow their head 
              slightly than to shake hands."
Vietnam,Meeting and Greeting,"When greeting someone, say “xin chao” (seen chow) + given name 
              + title. The Vietnamese are delighted if a Westerner can properly 
              say “xin chao” (because Vietnamese is a tonal language, “xin chao” 
              can have six different meanings, only one of which is ""Hello"")."
Vietnam,Body Language,"Summoning someone with a curled index finger, as is done in 
              the West, is only done by the boss. To beckon someone, extend your 
              arm, palm down, and move your fingers in a scratching motion. Only 
              beckon someone who has a ""lower"" status than you."
Vietnam,Body Language,"Men and women do not show affection in public. However, 
              members of the same sex may hold hands while walking."
Vietnam,Body Language,"Always use both hands when passing an object to another 
              person."
Vietnam,Body Language,"Touching children on the head is only done by parents, 
              grandparents, etc."
Vietnam,Corporate Culture,"Business cards are usually exchanged when meeting for the 
              first time. Give and receive a business card with both hands."
Vietnam,Corporate Culture,"The Vietnamese are generally quite punctual and expect 
              foreigners to be the same. That said, the Vietnamese can be very 
              flexible and accommodating when situations occur that are beyond 
              the control of one of the parties involved (for example, a 
              washed-out street, traffic jam, etc.)."
Vietnam,Corporate Culture,"Few Vietnamese speak English well. An interpreter is usually 
              necessary."
Vietnam,Corporate Culture,"A foreigner doing business in Vietnam will have to deal with 
              government officials. You may have to go through the same slow 
              procedure dozens of times to obtain the necessary permits to 
              operate a foreign-owned company in Vietnam. Continual, direct 
              contact with the ministry officials responsible for granting or 
              approving your permits and licenses is very important. 
              Difficulties may arise when one official refuses to honor an 
              agreement concluded by another official."
Vietnam,Corporate Culture,"Most decisions are made by committee in Vietnam. Individual 
              connections are not as important as in many other Asian countries, 
              because no one holds absolute power to make a decision. You can 
              not rely on one person in a particular organization to safeguard 
              your interests."
Vietnam,Corporate Culture,"The Vietnamese willingness to avoid unpleasantness can 
              sometimes lead to great misunderstandings. ""Yes"" may not mean 
              ""yes."" When the Vietnamese say ""No problem,"" you can take it to 
              mean ""Yes, there is a problem."" Double and even triple-check all 
              commitments, and then monitor them closely."
Vietnam,Corporate Culture,"Your local partner in Vietnam is very important and should be 
              chosen very carefully."
Vietnam,Corporate Culture,"Corruption is widespread. All manners of payoffs, kickbacks 
              and ""gifts"" are quite common. Be aware that corruption will not 
              only affect your costs, but also may contribute to unexpected 
              delays in delivery and the processing of licenses."
Vietnam,Dining and Entertainment,"A small dish or shaker of white crystal on the table is more 
              likely to be monosodium glutamate (MSG) than sugar or salt."
Vietnam,Dining and Entertainment,"The Vietnamese style of dining is chopsticks and rice bowls. 
              Hold your rice bowl in your hand; it is considered lazy to eat 
              from a rice bowl that is on the table."
Vietnam,Dining and Entertainment,"The host may serve guests, but will usually just invite 
              everyone to begin helping themselves. Food is placed on dishes in 
              the center of the table from which each person helps him/herself."
Vietnam,Dining and Entertainment,"An offer of tea at a reception or meeting is a ritual form of 
              hospitality and should not be refused."

Vietnam,Gifts,"Give items useful for daily activity, like designer soaps, 
              cosmetics, lamps or framed pictures for the home."
Vietnam,Gifts,"Don't give handkerchiefs (symbols of a sad farewell). Most 
              Asians consider the Western habit of using a cloth handkerchief 
              and then returning it to your pocket to be barbaric."
Vietnam,Gifts,"In business, give whiskey. Giving a gift in an office setting 
              may be misinterpreted as a bribe. Try to save your business gift 
              giving until you are invited to your colleague's home."
Vietnam,Helpful Hints,"Walk quickly, and avoid eye contact on the street."
Vietnam,Helpful Hints,"Refer to Ho Chi Minh City as Saigon. Local people prefer 
              Saigon to Ho Chi Minh City, which was imposed by the government in 
              Hanoi."
Vietnam,Especially for Women,"In the major cities, little sexual discrimination exists, and 
              Vietnamese women receive equal pay for equal work. In the country, 
              men are still boss."
Vietnam,Especially for Women,"Western women should dress conservatively in Vietnam. Women 
              who wear heavy makeup and revealing clothing are viewed as 
              prostitutes."
Vietnam,Especially for Women,"When dining with a Vietnamese man, a western businesswoman 
              should arrange to eat in a public place and should insist upon 
              hosting. If the Vietnamese man hosts, the Western woman is obliged 
              to reciprocate with a meal of equal value."

              down to business."

              shorten negotiations."
Argentina,Corporate Culture,"Contracts are lengthy and detailed. A contract is not final

              an important person."
Argentina,Corporate Culture,"The pace of business in Argentina is slower than in the United

Australia,Helpful Hints,"Stick with standard English, not Aussie terms."
Australia,Helpful Hints,"Aussies dislike class distinctions and have a history of 
              ""cutting down the tall poppy."" This grew out of the Australian 
              prisoners' hatred of their British overseers. Many Australian

              a deal. Plan on making several trips to complete business

              community. Third-party contacts will be vital to your success."

Bolivia,Helpful Hints,"Don't talk about poverty, religion, drugs or the United

              business endeavor."

              more important than a legal document in business."

              right down to business. Engage in conversation first."

              communication. You will be able to do only limited business by 
              phone, fax or e-mail."
Brazil,Corporate Culture,"Some facts may not be completely accurate during the early 
              stages of business negotiations. Brazilians expect some initial 
              hype and will passionately argue their points, slowly and 
              grudgingly making concessions. Try to maintain consistency in your 
              negotiating team."

              or Rio."
Brazil,Dining and Entertainment,"Brazilians always wash their hands before eating and rarely

              hand and quietly say ""Garçon."" To request the check, say ""A conta,

              be manicured."
Brazil,Dress,"In business situations, men should wear conservative dark 
              suits, shirts and ties. Three piece suits indicate executives; two 
              piece suits indicate office workers. Women should wear feminine 
              dresses, suits and pantsuits and avoid ""dressing like a man."""
Brazil,Gifts,"Gifts are not important in establishing a business

              contacts. A very expensive gift may be viewed as a bribe."

              business meeting."

              dinner."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,"Don’t assume that the ""self-made"" businessperson is admired in 
              Brazil. Inherited wealth and a good family background are much 
              more desirable."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,"Brazilians are extremely casual about time. Being ten to 
              fifteen minutes late in business is normal, and twenty to thirty 
              minutes late is not unusual. Be on time for a formal meeting, but 
              prepare to wait for your Brazilian colleagues."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,"Soccer (football), family, Brazil’s beautiful beaches and the 
              country’s rapid growth are all appropriate conversation topics. 
              Politics, poverty, religion, Argentina (considered a rival) and 
              the deforestation of Brazil are not. Personal topics such as age,

              places."
Brazil,Helpful Hints,Don’t refer to Brazilians as Latins.
Brazil,Especially for Women,"As women increasingly join the workforce, machismo has become 
            less common. Younger, better-educated women have values that 
            correspond closely to those of North American women. Women are 
            well-accepted and are prominent in education, medicine and 
            journalism and as small business owners."

              and personal lives."

Brazil,Especially for Women,"Be very careful not to ruin a business deal by being cool and 
              too professional."
Brazil,Especially for Women,"It is traditional to invite someone for a drink after work. 
              This is not a come-on."
Brazil,Especially for Men,"Brazilian women can be very aggressive romantically and forward 
            to the point of harassment. Don’t be surprised if you are in a 
            restaurant or nightclub and a woman sends you a note asking for your 
            phone number — even if you are with your wife or girlfriend. Foreign 
            men traveling to Brazil should be very cautious when dealing with 
            Brazilian women. If you don’t want the attention, be cordial but 
            keep your distance. Don’t be overly friendly."

Canada,Regional Differences,"Atlantic Canada (includes the Maritimes -- Nova Scotia, New 
            Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island -- and Newfoundland): Primarily 
            of British descent, the residents of the less prosperous Atlantic 
            provinces of eastern Canada are generally more reserved, stolid, 
            provincial and old-fashioned. Newfoundland is unique, with a dialect 
            and culture that draws comparisons with the Irish and the people of 
            western England."
Canada,Regional Differences,"Ontario: Residents of Canada's most populous province -- the 
            country's economic, political and cultural colossus -- are generally 
            thought of as more business-like and conservative than other 
            Canadians."
Canada,Regional Differences,"Western Canada (includes Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba): 
            Residents of Canada's western provinces are generally more open, 
            relaxed, friendly and direct than other Canadians (comparisons are 
            often made with inhabitants of the western United States)."
Canada,Regional Differences,"British Columbia: Canada's unconventional westernmost province is 
            seen by Canadians as the land of the future, and has more in common 
            with Seattle than Toronto. Like many other western Canadians, many 
            residents of British Columbia feel somewhat estranged from 
            ""easterners"" (a general code word for those from Ontario and 
            Quebec)."
Canada,Regional Differences,"Quebec (and other areas of Francophone Canada): French Canadians, 
            and especially the Québécois (or citizens of Quebec, pronounced 
            ""keh-beck-wah"") have a very strong sense of cultural identity and 
            are very nationalistic. The European influence is strongly felt in 
            Quebec, whose people consider themselves the ""defenders of French 
            civilization in North America."" Because of their animated good 
            nature, Québécois are sometimes called the ""Latins of the North."""
Canada,Regional Differences,"The North: Residents of the sparsely populated north are seen as 
            rugged embodiments of the Canadian pioneer spirit."
Canada,Meeting and Greeting,"In general, Canadians are more reserved and polite than 
              Americans, and take matters of etiquette a little more seriously."
Canada,Meeting and Greeting,"Shake hands and introduce yourself when meeting Canadians for 
              the first time. Always shake hands firmly when meeting or 
              departing. Eye contact is important."
Canada,Meeting and Greeting,"When a woman enters or leaves a room, it is polite for men to 
              rise. Men normally offer their hands to women."
Canada,Meeting and Greeting,"In Quebec, kissing on the cheeks in the French manner is quite 
              common. When close friends and family meet in Quebec, they use 
              first names and kiss both cheeks."
Canada,Meeting and Greeting,"An older French Canadian man may kiss the hand of a woman. 
              Accept this gesture graciously. A foreign man shouldn't kiss the 
              hand of a French Canadian woman, who would be quite shocked."
Canada,Meeting and Greeting,"Canadians are somewhat more formal than Americans with regard 
              to names and titles. Use last names and appropriate titles until 
              invited by your Canadian hosts or colleagues to use their first 
              names. First names are normally used only by close friends and 
              family. Western Canadians may use first names more frequently than 
              other Canadians."
Canada,Meeting and Greeting,"In Quebec, coworkers of similiar status generally use first 
              names in private, but always last names in public. The formal 
              ""you"" is almost always used in a business setting, even after 20 
              years."
Canada,Meeting and Greeting,"Academic titles and degrees are important to French Canadians. 
              You should know and use them properly."

              Canada. However, virtually all international business is conducted 
              in English."
Canada,Language,"Most French Canadians speak and understand English, but prefer 
              to use French. Check ahead of time to find out if an interpreter 
              will be necessary."
Canada,Body Language,"Generally speaking, Canadians are more reserved than 
              Americans. Canadians generally don't touch very much when 
              conversing. Maintaining a certain amount of personal space is 
              important."
Canada,Body Language,"French Canadians are generally more animated and expressive 
              than other Canadians."
Canada,Body Language,Take off your hat or sunglasses when speaking with someone.
Canada,Body Language,"Some gestures have different meanings in Quebec. For example, 
              ""thumbs down"" is considered offensive in Quebec, as is slapping an 
              open palm over a closed fist. Like the rest of their countrymen 
              and women, French-Canadians use the ""thumbs up"" sign to mean 
              ""okay. ""The ""okay"" sign made with the index finger and thumb means 
              ""zero"" in Quebec."
Canada,Body Language,"In Quebec, sit straight with your legs crossed at the knee, or 
              with your knees together. Don't sit with your legs apart, or with 
              your feet propped up on tables or chairs."
Canada,Body Language,"It's considered bad form by many in Quebec to talk with your 
              hands in your pockets."
Canada,Body Language,"Sneeze or blow your nose as quietly as possible using a 
              handkerchief or tissue. If possible, leave the room. Do not yawn 
              or scratch in public. Toothpicks, nail clippers, and combs are 
              never used in public."
Canada,Corporate Culture,"Punctuality is demanded for business meetings and social 
              occasions. If a conflict arises, you are expected to let your 
              Canadian counterpart know immediately. That said, Canadians are 
              not as obsessed with time as Americans."
Canada,Corporate Culture,Business cards are commonly exchanged in Canada.
Canada,Corporate Culture,"For Quebec, print your business cards in English or French, 
              including your academic degree(s) and/or title. A double-sided 
              business card (one side in English, one side in French) is best."
Canada,Corporate Culture,"Canadians get down to business quickly. Meetings are 
              well-organized, and extraneous discussion is kept to a minimum. A 
              premium is placed on time."
Canada,Corporate Culture,"Business communication is quite direct in Canada, but more 
              reserved than in the United States. Letters and telephone calls 
              should be direct and succinct. Pleasantries are dispensed with 
              very quickly."
Canada,Corporate Culture,"Business culture varies somewhat throughout Canada, depending 
              on the region."
Canada,Corporate Culture,"Although the relationship between Canada and the United States 
              is generally quite good, some Canadians may be wary about the 
              intentions of American businesses and put off by what they 
              perceive as American arrogance. Some Canadians may dislike the 
              American ""hard sell"" approach."
Canada,Dining and Entertainment,"To beckon a waiter in Quebec, quietly to say ""Monsieur"" or 
              ""S'il vous plait. Say ""Mademoiselle"" to beckon a waitress. Never 
              beckon a waiter or waitress by snapping your fingers or shouting."
Canada,Dining and Entertainment,"The host normally offers first toast. Wait until everyone is 
              served wine and a toast is proposed before drinking. It is 
              acceptable for women to propose a toast."
Canada,Dining and Entertainment,Wine is normally served with meals in Quebec.
Canada,Dining and Entertainment,"In Quebec, it's considered bad form to ask for a martini or 
              scotch before dinner — French Canadians consider them ""palate 
              numbing."" Typical before-dinner drinks include Pernod, kir, 
              champagne, and vermouth. Cognac, Grand Marnier and/or other 
              liqueurs are served after dinner."
Canada,Dining and Entertainment,"Business entertainment is common, but the focus usually 
              remains on business. The person who invites is normally expected 
              to pay."
Canada,Dining and Entertainment,"Etiquette and formalities are more important in Canada than in 
              the United States."
Canada,Dining and Entertainment,"While continental-style table manners are employed in Quebec, 
              American style table manners are seen in other parts of the 
              country."
Canada,Dining and Entertainment,"Eating while walking or standing on the street in Quebec is 
              considered bad form."
Canada,Dining and Entertainment,"Never arrive early for a social occasion. Opt, instead, for 
              being ""fashionably late."" Showing up early at a bar or disco in 
              Quebec (at, say, 10 o'clock) immediately marks you as an ""Anglo."""
Canada,Dress,"Generally speaking, Canadians dress more conservatively (and 
              more formally when going out) than their American neighbors, 
              although practices vary by region. Dress in Vancouver, for 
              example, is somewhat more casual; in Toronto more British. French 
              Canadians dress in a more relaxed European style than their fellow 
              Canadians."
Canada,Dress,"For business meetings, men should wear suits and ties; women 
              should wear conservative suits or dresses."
Canada,Gifts,"Bring flowers, fine wine or chocolates for the hostess when 
              invited to a Canadian home. Avoid red roses (associated with 
              romantic love) and white lilies (associated with funerals)."
Canada,Helpful Hints,"Do your homework about Canada. Most Americans are appallingly 
              ignorant of Canadian history, culture and geography."
Canada,Helpful Hints,"Recognize that important regional differences exist in Canada 
              and prepare to adapt."
Canada,Helpful Hints,"When in Quebec, learn a little French; Québécois greatly 
              appreciate it when you take the effort to talk to them in their 
              native language."
Canada,Helpful Hints,Do not compare Canada with the United States.
Canada,Helpful Hints,"Do not use the term ""Native Americans"" to refer to indigenous 
              peoples. Many Canadians find the term offensive. Canadians refer 
              to members of these groups as ""people of the First Nations."""
Canada,Helpful Hints,"Do not take sides in debates about contentious national issues 
              (especially when they concern such issues the status of Quebec, 
              the place of the French and English languages in Canadian society, 
              etc.)."

              away."
Chile,Body Language,Never click your fingers to or at anyone.

              not use this gesture."
Chile,Body Language,"Hitting the palm of your left hand with your right fist is 
              considered a vulgar gesture."

              rest of South America."
Chile,Corporate Culture,"Punctuality is generally respected and expected in business. 
              However, be prepared for Chileans to be thirty minutes late."
Chile,Corporate Culture,"Chileans don’t like to feel pressured or rushed. Business may 
              be conducted more slowly than in Europe and North America."
Chile,Corporate Culture,"Expertise is less important than your personal, family and 
              company background. Family and friendship play a big role in 
              business, and whom one knows is important. Red tape can be 
              minimized considerably if you have the right connections."
Chile,Corporate Culture,"Establish rapport first. Personal relationships are vital to 
              doing business in Chile. Some light conversation is customary 
              before getting down to business."
Chile,Corporate Culture,"Decision-making is centralized and decisions are made at the 
              top level, although all levels have input. Visit top-level 
              executives first. Mid-level executives can follow up on subsequent 
              visits."
Chile,Corporate Culture,"Be prepared to always go through a secretary. Secretaries are 
              screeners for their bosses."
Chile,Corporate Culture,"It is preferable to conduct business face-to-face rather than 
              over the phone or via fax. Be prepared to take several trips to 
              finish a business transaction."
Chile,Corporate Culture,"It is acceptable, but not yet common, to communicate via 
              e-mail; don’t expect a quick response."
Chile,Corporate Culture,"Businesslike behavior with a bit of humor is appreciated. Do 
              not attempt a hard sell approach, and avoid aggressive behavior."
Chile,Corporate Culture,"Expect to be interrupted. This is not considered rude, but 
              rather a way of showing interest and enthusiasm."
Chile,Corporate Culture,"Present a well-organized plan with terms clearly defined and 
              financial obligations and options clearly stated."

Chile,Corporate Culture,Always get written confirmation of agreements.
Chile,Corporate Culture,"Stay at a top-notch hotel; you will be judged by your 
              accommodations."
Chile,Dining and Entertainment,"Business lunches are usually long and are held in restaurants, 
              hotels or residences."
Chile,Dining and Entertainment,"Correct European-style table manners are vital. It is very 
              important to know which flatware to use. Forks and knives should 
              be used for everything eaten at a table."
Chile,Dining and Entertainment,"Keep both hands above the table at all times, never on your 
              lap."
Chile,Dining and Entertainment,"Don’t lick your fingers or use toothpicks — both are 
              considered vulgar."
Chile,Dining and Entertainment,"Water is not automatically served at the table. If you want 
              water, ask for it."
Chile,Dining and Entertainment,"Taste everything that is served. Compliment the host or 
              hostess on the meal."
Chile,Dining and Entertainment,"Conversation is free, friendly and open at the table, but be 
              careful not to speak with food in your mouth."
Chile,Dining and Entertainment,"Never leave immediately after dinner. Stay for conversation 
              after the meal."
Chile,Dining and Entertainment,"An invitation for drinks at a private home generally includes 
              dinner. Guests should reciprocate with comparable hospitality at a 
              later time."
Chile,Dining and Entertainment,"There are no separate checks. The person who invites pays. 
              Arrange in advance to pay the bill in a restaurant if you are the 
              host. You will not be presented with a bill in a restaurant until 
              you ask for it."
Chile,Dining and Entertainment,"Always arrive late for social functions. Being fifteen to 
              thirty minutes late for dinner and thirty minutes late for a party 
              is customary."
Chile,Dress,"Appearance is important to Chileans who favor sophisticated 
              European styles. It is important to be neatly and cleanly dressed 
              for all occasions."
Chile,Dress,"Men should wear jackets regardless of where they are or how 
              hot it is. Conservative, dark suits should be worn for business."
Chile,Dress,"Women should wear dresses and suits for business. Bare legs

Chile,Dress,Chilean women do not favor overtly sexy clothing.
Chile,Gifts,"Business gifts are not expected until a relationship is

              lighters, office accessories, a clock or liquor."
Chile,Gifts,Open gifts immediately in front of the giver.
Chile,Gifts,"Bring a bouquet of flowers to the hostess, or send flowers in 
              advance of a party. Give wine, chocolates, local crafts from your 
              home, small porcelain pieces or an art object to hang on a wall. 
              Gifts for children are appreciated."
Chile,Helpful Hints,Do not make comparisons between the United States and Chile.
Chile,Helpful Hints,"Show interest in and talk about family, especially children."
Chile,Helpful Hints,"Do not talk about politics or human rights, especially as a 
              foreigner, unless your host initiates the discussion."
Chile,Helpful Hints,"When smoking, offer a cigarette to everyone. Chileans have a 
              saying for those who neglect to share: ""Did you learn to smoke in 
              jail?"""
Chile,Especially for Women,"Traditionally, men have dominated private and public life in 
            Chile. However, attitudes are changing at home and in the workplace. 
            Women now make up 30% of the labor. In addition, many women hold 
            important political and business positions as ministers and top 
            executives."
Chile,Especially for Women,"Chile is an easier place for women to conduct business than 
              other parts of South America. However, businesswomen may still 
              encounter a machismo ethic."
Chile,Especially for Women,"Typical North American businesswomen are often viewed as cold, 
              pushy and non-feminine."
Chile,Especially for Women,"Men almost always pay the bill in a restaurant and may be 
              embarrassed if a woman attempts to pay. This shouldn’t be pressed. 
              Don’t argue. If it is important for you to pay, make arrangements 
              in advance."
Chile,Especially for Women,"It is common for men to stare at women. It is harmless and 
              meant to flatter."

China,Meeting and Greeting,"Shake hands upon meeting. Chinese may nod or bow instead of 
              shaking hands, although shaking hands has become increasingly 
              common."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"When introduced to a Chinese group, they may greet you with 
              applause. Applaud back."
China,Meeting and Greeting,"Senior persons begin greetings. Greet the oldest, most senior 
              person before others. During group introductions, line up 
              according to seniority with the senior person at the head of the 
              line."
China,Names and Titles,"Use family names and appropriate titles until specifically 
              invited by your Chinese host or colleagues to use their given 
              names."
China,Names and Titles,"Address the Chinese by Mr., Mrs., Miss plus family name. Note: 
              married women always retain their maiden name."
China,Names and Titles,"Chinese are often addressed by their government or 
              professional titles. For example, address Li Pang using his title: 
              Mayor Li or Director Li."
China,Names and Titles,"Names may have two parts; for example: Wang Chien. Traditional 
              Chinese family names are placed first with the given name (which 
              has one or two syllables) coming last (family name: Wang; given: 
              Chien)."
China,Names and Titles,"Chinese generally introduce their guests using their full 
              titles and company names. You should do the same. Example: Doctor 
              John Smith, CEO of American Data Corporation."
China,Body Language,"The Chinese dislike being touched by strangers. Do not touch, 
              hug, lock arms, back slap or make any body contact."
China,Body Language,Clicking fingers or whistling is considered very rude.
China,Body Language,"Never put your feet on a desk or a chair. Never gesture or 
              pass an object with your feet."
China,Body Language,"Blowing one's nose in a handkerchief and returning it to one's 
              pocket is considered vulgar by the Chinese."
China,Body Language,"To beckon a Chinese person, face the palm of your hand 
              downward and move your fingers in a scratching motion. Never use 
              your index finger to beckon anyone."
China,Body Language,"Sucking air in quickly and loudly through lips and teeth 
              expresses distress or surprise at a proposed request. Attempt to 
              change your request, allowing the Chinese to save face."
China,Body Language,"Chinese point with an open hand. Never point with your index 
              finger."
China,Corporate Culture,"The Chinese are practical in business and realize they need 
            Western investment, but dislike dependency on foreigners. They are 
            suspicious and fearful of being cheated or pushed around by 
            foreigners, who are perceived as culturally and economically 
            corrupt. It is very difficult to break through the ""them vs. us"" 
            philosophy (foreign partner vs. Chinese). In personal relationships, 
            the Chinese will offer friendship and warm hospitality without 
            conflict, but in business they are astute negotiators."
China,Corporate Culture,"Punctuality is important for foreign businesspeople. Being 
              late is rude. Meetings always begin on time."
China,Corporate Culture,"Business cards are exchanged upon meeting. Business cards 
              should be printed in English on one side and Chinese on the other. 
              Make sure the Chinese side uses ""simplified"" characters and not 
              ""classical"" characters, which are used in Taiwan and Hong Kong."
China,Corporate Culture,"English is not spoken in business meetings, although some 
              Chinese may understand English without making it known. Hire an 
              interpreter or ask for one to be provided."
China,Corporate Culture,"Be prepared for long meetings and lengthy negotiations (often 
              ten days straight) with many delays."
China,Corporate Culture,"The Chinese will enter a meeting with the highest-ranking 
              person entering first. They will assume the first member of your 
              group to enter the room is the leader of your delegation. The 
              senior Chinese person welcomes everyone. The foreign leader 
              introduces his/her team, and each member distributes his/her card. 
              The leader invites the Chinese to do the same."
China,Corporate Culture,"Seating is very important at a meeting. The host sits to the 
              left of the most important guest."
China,Corporate Culture,"There may be periods of silence at a business meeting; do not 
              interrupt these."
China,Corporate Culture,"A contract is considered a draft subject to change. Chinese 
              may agree on a deal and then change their minds. A signed contract 
              is not binding and does not mean negotiations will end."
China,Corporate Culture,"Observing seniority and rank are extremely important in 
              business."
China,Corporate Culture,"The status of the people who make the initial contact with the 
              Chinese is very important. Don't insult the Chinese by sending 
              someone with a low rank."
China,Corporate Culture,"Chinese negotiators may try to make foreign negotiators feel 
              guilty about setbacks; they may then manipulate this sense of 
              guilt to achieve certain concessions."
China,Corporate Culture,"Two Chinese negotiating tricks designed to make you agree to 
              concessions are staged temper tantrums and a feigned sense of 
              urgency."
China,Corporate Culture,"If the Chinese side no longer wishes to pursue the deal, they 
              may not tell you. To save their own face, they may become 
              increasingly inflexible and hard-nosed, forcing you to break off 
              negotiations. In this way, they may avoid blame for the failure."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Dining is used to probe positions without any formal 
              commitment. Business is generally not discussed during meals. 
              Meals are a vehicle for indirect business references."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"The Chinese are superb hosts. Twelve-course banquets with 
              frequent toasts are a Chinese trademark."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"The Chinese sponsoring organization generally hosts a 
              welcoming banquet. Foreign guests should reciprocate toward the 
              end of their visits. Invite everyone with whom you have dealt."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Always arrive exactly on time for a banquet. Never arrive 
              early for dinner. This implies that you are hungry and might cause 
              you to lose face."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Spouses are not usually included in business entertaining, 
              however, businesspeople may bring their secretaries."
China,Dining and Entertainment,Be prepared to make a small toast for all occasions.
China,Dining and Entertainment,"The first toast normally occurs during or after the first 
              course, not before. After the next course, the guest should 
              reciprocate."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Three glasses -- a large one for beer, soda or mineral water, 
              a small wine glass and a stemmed shot glass -- are at each place 
              setting. The shot glass is the one used for toasting."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"It is not necessary to always drain your glass after a ganbei 
              (bottoms up), although a host should encourage it."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Do not drink until you toast others at the table. Chinese 
              consider drinking alone to be rude. Simply raising your glass and 
              making eye contact is sufficient. If you are toasted, sip your 
              drink in reply."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"A toast to friendship among companies will help cement a 
              business relationship."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Unless you are totally drunk, it is not advised to refuse a 
              drink. Sipping your drink is perfectly acceptable."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Leave some food on your plate during each course of a meal to 
              honor the generosity of your host. It is bad manners for a Chinese 
              host not to keep refilling guests' plates or teacups."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Seating is very important. The guest of honor is always placed 
              at the head of the room, facing the door. Allow the host to begin 
              eating before joining in."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Do not discuss business at dinner unless your Chinese 
              counterpart initiates it."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Slurping soup and belching are acceptable. Cover your mouth 
              with your hand when using a toothpick. Put bones, seeds, etc. on 
              the table, never in your rice bowl."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Chopsticks are used for all meals. Tapping your chopsticks on 
              the table is considered very rude."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"When finished eating, place your chopsticks neatly on the 
              table or on the chopstick rest."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"When hosting, order one dish for every person present and one 
              extra. In addition, order rice, noodles and buns. Soup usually 
              comes at some point during the meal. The host should tell his/her 
              guests to begin eating a new dish before he digs in himself."
China,Dining and Entertainment,The host (the one who invites) pays the bill for everyone.
China,Dining and Entertainment,"If you are the guest of honor at a dinner, leave shortly after 
              the meal is finished, as no one will leave before the guest of 
              honor."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Breakfast meetings are rare, but you may request one."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Guests are rarely invited to a Chinese home. It is an honor to 
              be a guest. Be on time or a little early for an invitation, and 
              take a small gift."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"Bedrooms and kitchens are private. Don't enter these rooms 
              unless you are invited to do so."
China,Dining and Entertainment,"All dishes are served at once in a home. The host will place 
              portions of each dish on guests' plates. Sample each dish."
China,Dining and Entertainment,Rare beef is considered barbaric by the Chinese.
China,Dress,"Conservative, simple, unpretentious, modest clothing should be 
              worn -- nothing flashy or overly fashionable."
China,Dress,"Women should avoid bare backs, shorts, low-cut tops and 
              excessive jewelry."
China,Dress,"For business, men should wear sport coats and ties. Slacks and 
              open-necked shirts are generally suitable in the summer for 
              business meetings; jackets and ties are not necessary."
China,Dress,"Women should wear dresses or pantsuits for business and should 
              avoid heavy make-up and dangling, gaudy jewelry."
China,Gifts,"Present a gift with both hands. Gifts are generally not opened 
              upon receiving. Always give a gift to everyone present or don't 
              give gifts at all."
China,Gifts,"Older Chinese usually refuse a gift at first to be polite. 
              Offer a second time."
China,Gifts,"Never give a gift of great value until a clear relationship is 
              established. This would cause embarrassment and may not be 
              accepted. Never give gifts in sets (i.e., dishes), but never in 
              sets of four (a number associated with death)."
China,Gifts,"Avoid white, which is symbolic of death, especially of 
              parents, and black, which symbolizes tragedy or death."
China,Gifts,"When invited to someone's home, always bring a small gift for 
              the hostess, such as brandy, chocolates or cakes."
China,Gifts,"Be prepared to exchange a modest gift with your business 
              colleagues at the first meeting. Not giving a gift could start a 
              business meeting off on the wrong foot."
China,Gifts,"Always give gifts to each member of the Chinese delegation 
              that meets you in the order in which they were introduced. 
              Suggested gifts: cigarettes (especially Marlboro and Kent), French 
              brandy, whiskey, pens, lighters, desk attire, cognac, books, 
              framed paintings. Give more valuable gifts — like cellular phones 
              or small CD players — to senior level people."
China,Gifts,"Give a group gift from your company to the host company. 
              Present this gift to the leader of the delegation."

China,Helpful Hints,"Never say or act like you are starving and don’t ask for a 
              doggy bag."
China,Helpful Hints,"Most Chinese women don't wear wedding rings. Don't assume 
              marital status."
China,Especially for Women,"China is a difficult place for anyone to conduct business. A 
              woman may gain acceptance, but it will take time and will not be 
              easy."
China,Especially for Women,"China is a male-dominated society. However, there are many 
              women in business in China and some occupy high-ranking positions 
              and important managerial jobs. One of the principles of the 
              Chinese communist system is to work toward sexual equality."

              decline unpopular proposals."
China,Especially for Women,"Businesswomen attend business dinners, but rarely bring their 
              spouses."

Colombia,Body Language,Smiling is very important.
Colombia,Body Language,"Never put your feet on furniture in a hotel, office or home."
Colombia,Body Language,"Yawning is impolite and viewed as a sign of hunger or 
              sleepiness. Always cover your mouth when yawning."
Colombia,Body Language,"It is considered demeaning to beckon someone with your index 
              finger. Instead, beckon with your palm down, waving your fingers 
              or your whole hand."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"Colombians are normally punctual in business, although they 
              may be up to a half-hour late. The best policy for foreign 
              businesspeople is to be punctual, but prepared to wait. Don't get 
              angry if a 12:00 p.m. appointment doesn't begin until 12:30 p.m. 
              Excuse yourself if you are late."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"“In an hour or two” may mean tomorrow or next week. “Tomorrow” 
              seldom means tomorrow and may mean next week. Don't get offended 
              if someone says they will phone you tomorrow and then calls a week 
              later."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"Colombians want to know you personally before they do business 
              with you. You must develop a relationship with your counterparts 
              before they will consider you trustworthy."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"Always allow your Colombian counterparts to bring up the 
              subject of business. Be aware that this may take awhile. Meetings 
              may be slow, with quiet, deliberate discussions."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"Follow up a meeting by sending a letter summarizing the main 
              points and what was agreed upon."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"It may take several trips to complete a business transaction.

              far” by phone and fax."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"Maintain eye contact during conversations, or you may leave a 
              bad impression."
Colombia,Corporate Culture,"Contracts may be long and detailed. Put the key aspects of 
              agreed-upon points in writing."

              hire a local distributor, representative, salesperson and/or 
              lawyer."
Colombia,Dining and Entertainment,"Time and punctuality are not stressed. Colombians will 
              typically arrive up to thirty minutes late for social engagements.

Colombia,Dress,"Colombians pay a lot of attention to appearance and clothing. 
              Dress conservatively and be well groomed."

Colombia,Dress,"For business, men should wear dark suits, white shirts and 
              ties in the cities. In warmer areas, dress is less formal. Women 
              should wear dresses and suits. Wear comfortable cotton in warmer 
              areas."

              calculators and gifts from your home region."
Colombia,Helpful Hints,Don't offer your opinions about local politics or religion.

              the United States' government in the war against drugs, but U.S. 
              foreign policy is not viewed positively by many Colombians."
Colombia,Helpful Hints,"If you are invited to a bullfight, do not decline. Tickets for 
              good seats are very expensive."
Colombia,Helpful Hints,"Do not be offended if you are called a “gringo.” Colombians 
              use this term to refer to people from the United States, and it is 
              not meant to be insulting."

              notwithstanding special courtesy and manners."
Colombia,Especially for Women,"United States businesswomen are received well in Colombia and 
              will be treated in a businesslike manner, although perhaps with 
              some curiosity. North American women should not have trouble doing 
              business in Colombia."
Colombia,Especially for Women,"Men may flirt or make comments; simply ignore them. Women 
              should be careful not to do anything that might be considered 
              flirtatious, which may be misinterpreted."

Denmark,Dining and Entertainment,"Toasting can be a very formal process. Never toast your hosts

              is a trifle chilly,"" when it is stifling hot."
Denmark,Helpful Hints,"Danes say ""thank you"" for everything--anytime, anywhere."

              rather than dinners."

              schools and are well-heeled, well-traveled and possess an 
              international perspective. The business climate in Hong Kong is 
              ""wide open,"" with a free market and limited government 
              involvement. Hong Kong business activities are competitive, honest 
              and quick. Making money is the main goal. The style of business is 
              similar to that of the United States."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Punctuality is expected and respected; be on time for all 
              appointments. Allow ""courtesy time"" (30 minutes) if someone is 
              late for an appointment with you."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Tea is served at meetings. Do not drink until your host takes 
              the first sip. A host leaving tea untouched signals the end of the 
              meeting."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Bring business cards printed in English on one side and 
              Chinese on the other side. Make sure that the Chinese side uses 
              ""classical"" characters, the written form of Chinese used in Hong 
              Kong, and not ""simplified"" characters, which are used in the 
              People's Republic of China. Upon introduction, present your 
              business card with both hands and with the Chinese side up."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Be sure to look at a business card upon receiving it. Do not 
              write on a business card in front of the person who gave it to 
              you."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Lawyers are not included in negotiations until contracts are 
              drawn up and signed."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Negotiations may be slow and detailed, but very efficient. 
              Send senior people with technical and commercial expertise 
              prepared to function as a team and make decisions on the spot. 
              Business deals may be sealed with a handshake alone. Be prepared 
              to compromise."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Banking contacts are very important. Use a bank to set up your 
              meetings."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Take time to build relationships. It may take several meetings 
              to accomplish goals. Do business face to face. Courtesy calls and 
              personal selling are vital to success."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"""Yes"" may not mean agreement; it often means ""I hear you."" 
              ""No"" is generally not said. Instead, you may hear ""I will have to 
              wait,"" or ""This may be very difficult."""
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Do not attempt to open an office in Hong Kong without hiring 
              or consulting a ""geomancer""/""feng shui"" professional. A feng shui 
              professional advises on facility, moving date, opening date, 
              entrance, etc. and positions office furniture to be in harmony 
              with cosmic forces. Do not ignore this custom. Many Chinese will 
              not do business without feng shui approval for fear of trouble 
              from spirits. Ask a Hong Kong businessperson for the name and 
              number of a reliable feng shui professional."
Hong Kong,Corporate Culture,"Make appointments for business meetings a month before 
              arrival."
Hong Kong,Dining and Entertainment,"Tea is the customary beverage for all occasions. Your teacup 
              will be refilled continually. Leave your cup full if you are 
              finished. Chinese find adding sugar and cream to tea a very 
              strange Western habit. Place teapot lid upside down (or open if 
              attached) to signal the waiter for more tea."
Hong Kong,Dining and Entertainment,"Toasting is an important part of a Chinese dinner. If you are 
              the guest of honor and are toasted, smile, raise your glass, make 
              eye contact, drink, raise your glass and thank the host and 
              guests."
Hong Kong,Dining and Entertainment,"The guest of honor rises and thanks the host for everyone 
              present at the end of dinner. Make a simple, polite, short toast 
              to friendship, success and cooperation."
Hong Kong,Dining and Entertainment,"The banquet host visits each table and makes a toast. A toast 
              is often made in the middle of a banquet when the shark fin soup 
              is served."
Hong Kong,Dining and Entertainment,"Be sure to eat and show appreciation for shark fin soup if it 
              is offered. This delicacy is offered only to special guests, and 
              is very expensive."
Hong Kong,Dining and Entertainment,"It is bad manners for a host not to keep a guest's plate full, 
              and it is even worse for a guest not to continue eating as long as 
              the plate is full. Always leave some food on your dish after you 
              are finished with each course. Otherwise the host will continue 
              refilling your plate or bowl."
Hong Kong,Dining and Entertainment,"Be sure to reciprocate with a banquet of equal quality. Your 
              hotel can assist you in preparations."
Hong Kong,Dining and Entertainment,"Rice is served as a filler. Do not eat large amounts, which 
              implies the host has not served enough food."
Hong Kong,Dining and Entertainment,"Lay your chopsticks on your chopstick rest or neatly on the 
              table when you are finished eating. Never stick them in a bowl of 
              rice."
Hong Kong,Dining and Entertainment,"Don't be afraid to dirty the tablecloth. Bones, shells, etc. 
              are put on the table; do not put them in your rice bowl. A plate 
              may be provided for this purpose."
Hong Kong,Dining and Entertainment,"The Chinese find belching, slurping, clanging utensils and 
              making loud noises at the dinner table acceptable, sometimes even 
              complimentary."
Hong Kong,Dining and Entertainment,"Oranges or other fruits are served to signal the end of the 
              meal. Leave soon after the meal ends."
Hong Kong,Dining and Entertainment,"Never refuse an invitation to lunch or dinner. If you can't 
              make the date, suggest another date."
Hong Kong,Dining and Entertainment,"Spouses are usually not included in business dining. Do not 
              bring a spouse unless invited to do so. If spouses are present, 
              business is generally not discussed."
Hong Kong,Dress,"Hong Kong residents are very style-conscious and dress well. 
              Modesty and cleanliness are very important."
Hong Kong,Dress,"All types of clothing are worn in Hong Kong. However, taste 
              and fashion look more toward Japan than Britain or the United 
              States. Clothing should be light for summer with sweaters and 
              jackets for winter."
Hong Kong,Dress,"For business, men should wear conservative and lightweight 
              Western-style suits and ties. Women should wear conservative 
              dresses, suits or skirts and blouses."
Hong Kong,Dress,Wear a good watch. It will be noticed.
Hong Kong,Dress,"The Chinese tend to dress up when going out in the evening. 
              Most European-style hotel restaurants require a coat and tie in 
              the evening. Women should wear cocktail dresses or evening pants."
Hong Kong,Gifts,"Gift giving is a tradition in Hong Kong that communicates 
              respect and friendship. Be prepared to present a small gift at the 
              first meeting, such as high-quality cognac, brandy, candy or pens. 
              Unlike other Asian countries, Scotch whiskey is not special in 
              Hong Kong."
Hong Kong,Gifts,Never go to a Chinese home without a gift.
Hong Kong,Gifts,"Present and receive a gift with both hands. Do not open a gift 
              upon receiving it."
Hong Kong,Gifts,"The word for the number ""3"" in Chinese sounds like the word 
              for ""life,"" and the word for the number ""8"" sounds like the word 
              for ""prosperity."" The Chinese word for number ""9"" is a homonym for 
              the word ""eternity."" Give gifts in these numbers, if possible. Do 
              not give gifts in a group of four; the Chinese word for ""4"" sounds 
              similar to the word for ""death."""
Hong Kong,Gifts,"Avoid giving white or red flowers (white is a symbol of 
              mourning, red is a symbol of blood); clocks are associated with 
              death, but watches are suitable gifts."
Hong Kong,Gifts,"Every conceivable product can be purchased in Hong Kong. Try 
              to bring something from your hometown or state."
Hong Kong,Gifts,It is illegal to give a civil servant a gift.
Hong Kong,Helpful Hints,"The Chinese are famous for communicating by ""Saying it without 
              saying it."" You will have to learn to read between the lines."
Hong Kong,Helpful Hints,Expect Hong Kong Chinese to ask personal questions.
Hong Kong,Helpful Hints,"Compliment Hong Kong Chinese, but expect a denial. Politely 
              deny a compliment to show humility. Do not say thank you."
Hong Kong,Helpful Hints,Do not speak loudly.
Hong Kong,Helpful Hints,"You may be referred to as ""Gweilo"" (foreign devil). While 
              perhaps insulting, it is generally not a personal attack."
Hong Kong,Helpful Hints,"Hong Kong Chinese are very superstitious; mentioning failure, 
              poverty or death offends them."
Hong Kong,Especially for Women,"Foreign businesswomen should have little trouble conducting 
              business in Hong Kong."

India,Meeting and Greeting,"Westerners may shake hands, however, greeting with 'namaste' 
              (na-mas-TAY) (placing both hands together with a slight bow) is 
              appreciated and shows respect for Indian customs."
India,Meeting and Greeting,"Men shake hands with men when meeting or leaving. Men do not 
              touch women when meeting or greeting. Western women may offer 
              their hand to a westernized Indian man, but not normally to 
              others. Traditional Indian women may shake hands with foreign 
              women but not usually with men."
India,Body Language,Public displays of affection are not proper.
India,Body Language,"Indians generally allow an arm's length space between

              personal space."
India,Body Language,"Indian men may engage in friendly back patting merely as a 
              sign of friendship."
India,Body Language,"When an Indian smiles and jerks his/her head backward -- a 
              gesture that looks somewhat like a Western ""no"" -- or moves his 
              head in a figure 8, this means ""yes."""
India,Body Language,"The Western side-to-side hand wave for ""hello"" is frequently 
              interpreted by Indians as ""no"" or ""go away."""
India,Body Language,"Use your right hand only to touch someone, pass money or pick 
              up merchandise. The left hand is considered unclean."
India,Body Language,Do not touch anyone's head. The head is considered sensitive.
India,Body Language,"Feet are considered unclean. Feet are sacred for holy men and 
              women. Pointing footwear at people is considered an insult."
India,Body Language,"Indians are very sensitive to being beckoned rudely. Hand and 
              arm waved up and down (Western ""good-bye"") means ""come here."" To 
              beckon, extend your arm, palm down and make a scratching motion 
              with fingers kept together."
India,Body Language,"Never point with a single finger or two fingers (used only 
              with inferiors). Point with your chin, whole hand or thumb. The 
              chin is not used to point at superiors."
India,Corporate Culture,"Business cards are exchanged and Indians are very conscious of 
              the protocol. Always present business cards when introduced. 
              English is appropriate for business cards."
India,Corporate Culture,"Decisions are strongly influenced from the top. Usually one 
              person makes all major decisions. Attempt to deal with the 
              highest-level person available."
India,Corporate Culture,"It is considered rude to plunge into business discussions 
              immediately. Ask about your counterpart’s family, interests, 
              hobbies, etc. before beginning business discussions."
India,Corporate Culture,"Business is slow and difficult in India. Be polite, but 
              persistent. Do not get angry if you are told something ""can't be 
              done."" Instead, restate your request firmly but with a smile. Plan 
              on several visits before you reach an agreement."
India,Corporate Culture,"You may be offered a sugary, milky tea, coffee or a soft 
              drink. Don’t refuse. Note that your glass or cup may be refilled

              prepared to reschedule."
India,Dining and Entertainment,"Initial business entertainment is done in restaurants in

              your host to initiate business conversation."
India,Dining and Entertainment,"Never flatly refuse an invitation to a home or dinner of a

              party."

India,Dining and Entertainment,"Allow hosts to serve you. Never refuse food, but don’t feel 
              obligated to empty your plate. Hindu hosts are never supposed to 
              let their guests’ plates be empty."
India,Dining and Entertainment,"If hosts eat with hands, assure them you enjoy doing the same. 
              If utensils are not used, use your right hand and your first three 
              fingers and thumb only."
India,Dining and Entertainment,"Take food from communal dish with a spoon; never your fingers.

India,Especially for Women,"India is a difficult place to do business, but particularly 
              tough for women. India is a male-dominated society. Western women

Indonesia,Meeting and Greeting,"Shake hands and give a slight nod when meeting for the first 
              time. After the first meeting, a handshake is not necessary; a 
              slight bow or nod of the head is sufficient. Shake an Indonesian 
              woman's hand only if she initiates the greeting."
Indonesia,Meeting and Greeting,"Greet people with ""Selamat"" (sell-a-mat), which means peace. 
              Say it slowly and sincerely."
Indonesia,Body Language,"Good relationships involve a great deal of physical contact 
              and touching. But, foreigners should allow time to be accepted and 
              to develop good relationships before this is acceptable."
Indonesia,Body Language,"Indonesians are used to an overcrowded society; they tend to 
              ignore inadvertent invasions of space. Allowing for personal space 
              is a sign of respect."

              Do not display affection in public."
Indonesia,Body Language,"The head is where the spirit resides and is considered sacred.

Indonesia,Body Language,"Keep both feet on the floor when sitting. Do not cross your 
              legs, especially not with an ankle over the knee. Sitting with 
              good posture (rigid) and both feet on the floor is a sign of 
              respect. Don’t allow the bottom of your feet to face or point at 
              another person."
Indonesia,Body Language,"Looking someone straight in the eyes is considered staring. 
              Avoid prolonged eye contact, which may be viewed as a challenge 
              and may cause anger."
Indonesia,Body Language,"Point with your thumb, not your index finger. Never beckon 
              with one finger."

              or receive anything, touch anyone or point with your left hand."

              American-style backslapping is considered offensive."
Indonesia,Corporate Culture,"Westerners are expected to be punctual for business

              Indonesians to arrive late."
Indonesia,Corporate Culture,"Present your business card to the receptionist immediately 
              upon arrival; otherwise, there could be long delays. Exchange 
              business cards when being introduced. Present and receive the card 
              slowly with much interest. Cards in English are acceptable."
Indonesia,Corporate Culture,"Negotiations should start at the top of a corporation and then 
              move down to the operating level to discuss technical matters. 
              Later on, discussions will return once again to the top level of 
              the company."
Indonesia,Corporate Culture,"It is best to conduct a first meeting with the highest ranking 
              person of a company. An introduction from a local associate or 
              bank representative is helpful."
Indonesia,Corporate Culture,"Indonesians don't get right down to business. An initial 
              meeting may last 45-60 minutes without accomplishing much. After 
              this amount of time, the visitor should initiate leaving."
Indonesia,Corporate Culture,"Patience is a necessity when doing business in Indonesia. 
              Business dealings are usually slow, long and frustrating. Business 
              relationships must be allowed to develop over time. Several visits 
              are generally necessary to complete a contract."
Indonesia,Corporate Culture,"Indonesians love to bargain. Giving concessions too quickly 
              will be viewed as naivete."

              negotiations. Avoid disagreement and, especially, arguments with 
              Indonesians."
Indonesia,Corporate Culture,"To Indonesians, insisting on a written contract is a breech of 
              trust, though many understand a Westerner’s need for such 
              documents. A contract should be viewed as a guideline rather than 
              a statement of duties and responsibilities."
Indonesia,Corporate Culture,"Personal visits are important to Indonesians. They do not take 
              well to faxes, telephone calls or messages. Show up in person 
              whenever possible."
Indonesia,Corporate Culture,"Indonesians want very much to please. An untruthful answer may 
              be given so as not to disappoint anyone."
Indonesia,Corporate Culture,"Indonesians rarely disagree in public. To succeed in 
              negotiations with Indonesians, do not apply pressure or be 
              confrontational."
Indonesia,Dining and Entertainment,"Social events generally start late. Indonesians usually arrive

              by Indonesians."
Indonesia,Dining and Entertainment,"A fork and spoon are used for dining. The fork is held in the 
              left hand and the spoon in the right. Use the fork to push food 
              onto the spoon."
Indonesia,Dining and Entertainment,Most Indonesians are Muslim and consume no liquor or pork.
Indonesia,Dining and Entertainment,"Indonesians are known for their hospitality. Do not reject 
              their hospitality, as it will be viewed as a personal rejection. 
              Never refuse food or drink, but never finish either completely. 
              Compliments about the food are appreciated. It is a special honor 
              to be invited to an Indonesian's home."
Indonesia,Dining and Entertainment,"The host is always the last to sit and eat. Men are generally 
              served first. Wait to be invited to eat or drink."
Indonesia,Dining and Entertainment,"The guest of honor or senior person begins the meal; this is a 
              distinct honor. If you are asked to begin the meal, you should 
              refuse twice and then begin."
Indonesia,Dining and Entertainment,"Fingers are still used for eating in some places. Both hands 
              are kept above the table while eating."
Indonesia,Dining and Entertainment,"The person who invites is expected to pay the bill in a 
              restaurant. Request the bill by making a scribbling gesture on the 
              palm of your hand."
Indonesia,Dining and Entertainment,"When finished with the meal, place the fork (tines down) on 
              your plate with your spoon (down) crossed over the fork."
Indonesia,Dining and Entertainment,"If possible, reciprocate with a dinner before you leave the 
              country. A lavish dinner may be criticized; be generous and 
              hospitable, but don't overdo it."
Indonesia,Dress,"Men should wear a suit and jacket for the first business 
              meeting."
Indonesia,Dress,"Women should wear skirts and blouses (never sleeveless) or 
              dresses. Avoid extreme fashions. Muslim rules of modesty should be 
              honored."
Indonesia,Gifts,"Business gifts are generally not exchanged. A small token of

              be."

Japan,Corporate Culture,"Etiquette and harmony are very important. ""Saving face"" is a 
              key concept. Japanese are anxious to avoid unpleasantness and

              after he has filled yours. While he is pouring, hold your cup or 
              glass up so he can fill it easily. Never pour your own drink and 
              always pour your companion's."
Japan,Dining and Entertainment,"Toasting is very important in Japan and many toasts are

Japan,Dining and Entertainment,"Wait for the most important person (honored guest) to begin

Japan,Dining and Entertainment,"When offered food, it is polite to hesitate before accepting. 
              You do not have to eat much, but it is rude not to sample each

              it makes them taste better."

              accompany your meal. Replace the lid of the soup bowl when 
              finished eating."
Japan,Dress,"Dress is modern and conservative. The Japanese dress well at

              the gift."
Japan,Gifts,"Allow your Japanese counterpart to initiate the gift giving. 
              Present a gift in a modest fashion, saying, ""This is just a small 
              token,"" or ""This is an insignificant gift."""
Japan,Gifts,"It is very important to receive a gift properly. Give a gift

Japan,Gifts,"Do not give anyone a gift unless you have one for everyone

Japan,Helpful Hints,"Avoid using the number ""four"" if possible. It has connotations 
              of death to the Japanese."
Japan,Helpful Hints,"The Japanese may ask personal questions. This is not intended

              vague or general answers if you feel a question is too personal."
Japan,Helpful Hints,"The Japanese do not express opinions and desires openly. What 
              they say and what they mean may be very different."
Japan,Helpful Hints,"Do not expect a Japanese person to say ""no."" ""Maybe"" generally 
              means ""no."""
Japan,Especially for Women,"Non-Japanese women are treated very politely in business and 
              it is understood that Western women hold high-level positions in 
              business. Western women must establish credibility and a position 
              of authority immediately."

              and a smile."

Malaysia,Body Language,"Use your right hand to eat, pass things and touch people. Do

Malaysia,Corporate Culture,"Business counterparts will want to get to know you personally 
              before doing business with you."

              probably involve you in polite conversation for a lengthy period 
              before getting down to business. Discussions will be long and 
              detailed."
Malaysia,Corporate Culture,"A letter of introduction from a bank or a mutual acquaintance 
              will help establish a business relationship. Without an

Malaysia,Corporate Culture,"Once an agreement is reached, don't be surprised if 
              counterparts try to renegotiate, even after a written agreement

              than personal trust. Expect requests for escape clauses."
Malaysia,Corporate Culture,"Malays will pressure you to make concessions, but won't give 
              up much themselves in the beginning of negotiations. Plan on

              not served before dinner."

Malaysia,Gifts,"Gifts are not exchanged at the first meeting, or in general,

              the presence of the giver."
Malaysia,Gifts,"Always bring a small gift for the hostess when invited to

Malaysia,Especially for Women,"Women are generally accepted in business, where they hold many 
              influential positions."

Mexico,Meeting and Greeting,Shake hands or give a slight bow when introduced.
Mexico,Meeting and Greeting,"Bow when greeting a Mexican woman. Shake hands only if she 
              extends her hand first."
Mexico,Body Language,"Mexicans generally stand close together when conversing. Don't 
              show signs of discomfort, which would be considered rude by your 
              Mexican counterpart."
Mexico,Body Language,"Mexicans often ""hold"" a gesture (a handshake, a squeeze of the 
              arm, a hug) longer than Americans and Canadians do."
Mexico,Body Language,"Don't stand with your hands on your hips; this signifies 
              anger. It is considered rude to stand around with your hands in 
              your pockets."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Punctuality is expected of foreign businesspeople. Your 
              Mexican counterpart may be late or keep you waiting. Thirty 
              minutes past the scheduled meeting time is considered punctual by 
              Mexicans."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Spanish is the language of business. You may need to hire an 
              interpreter (preferably a native speaker who understands the 
              language as it is spoken in Mexico)."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Meet with top executives first. Top-level Mexican executives 
              may not attend subsequent meetings, which often take place with 
              middle-level management and technical people. Don't feel insulted; 
              this shows that discussions are proceeding positively."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Negotiations move slowly. Be patient. For Mexicans, the 
              building of a personal relationship comes before the building of a 
              professional one."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Expect approximately ten to fifteen minutes of small talk 
              before getting down to business."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"If offered something to drink (usually coffee), don't refuse. 
              This would be seen as an insult."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Take some time for consideration before agreeing to anything. 
              Quick decisiveness is often seen as hasty."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"A promise does not mean that your request will be carried out. 
              You should always ask for written confirmation of any agreement or 
              commitment."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Management or other important people may sometimes make 
              unreasonable or overly aggressive demands to demonstrate their 
              importance within or to their own group. Be aware of such hidden 
              agendas."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Personalize everything. Explain how all proposals will benefit 
              a Mexican's country, community, family and, most important, the 
              Mexican personally."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Deal-making almost never occurs over the phone (and rarely by 
              letter). Mexicans prefer to do business in person."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Your local contact person or representative is very important 
              and should be chosen very carefully. A low-level representative 
              will be taken as an affront by status-conscious Mexicans, who will 
              assume that you are not really serious."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"The status of your hotel accommodations, the quality of your 
              clothes and watch, and whether or not you arrive in a chauffeured 
              limousine or in a taxi, etc. will be critically appraised by your 
              Mexican counterparts."
Mexico,Corporate Culture,"Be persistent! Don't give up if you don't receive a response 
              to your phone calls or letters right away or if your meetings are 
              continually postponed or canceled. If you give up, your Mexican 
              counterparts might assume that you weren't serious in the first 
              place."
Mexico,Dining and Entertainment,"Business entertainment is very important and it is during 
              these events that personal relationships should be developed."
Mexico,Dining and Entertainment,Always keep both hands above the table.
Mexico,Dining and Entertainment,"Don't leave the table immediately after you are finished 
              eating."
Mexico,Dining and Entertainment,"Drinking to excess is frowned upon in Mexico, especially when 
              it's done by women. Customarily, only men propose toasts; foreign 
              women normally shouldn't offer toasts."
Mexico,Dining and Entertainment,"Don’t show up on time for a social engagement -- you will be 
              the only one who does, and will most likely be waiting for a very 
              long time (possibly hours)."
Mexico,Dining and Entertainment,"To reciprocate, invite your Mexican counterparts to dinner at 
              a nice restaurant (French or Italian are your best bets). Pay in 
              advance to avoid arguments about the bill."
Mexico,Dining and Entertainment,"Businesspeople are often invited to visit the home of their 
              Mexican counterparts. On your first visit to a Mexican home, it is 
              best to wear business attire unless specifically told otherwise."
Mexico,Dress,"Men should always wear a shirt and tie, except at casual 
              affairs. Both men and women should dress conservatively. 
              Recommended colors are navy and dark gray."
Mexico,Dress,Women should always wear make-up.
Mexico,Gifts,"While gift giving is not always a necessity when doing 
              business in Mexico, gifts are much appreciated. Suggested initial 
              gifts include non-personal items with your corporate logo."
Mexico,Gifts,"Flowers should always be given when visiting a Mexican home. 
              It's OK to have them sent beforehand, or to bring them with you. 
              If you have them sent, make sure that they arrive before you do."
Mexico,Helpful Hints,"Any attempt to speak Spanish is appreciated by your Mexican 
              counterparts and is seen as a gesture of goodwill. Demonstrating 
              knowledge and appreciation of Mexican culture wins friends."
Mexico,Helpful Hints,"Mexicans are very proud of their independence and have a very 
              strong sense of national identity and pride. Never compare the way 
              things are done in Mexico with the way they are done in the United 
              States."
Mexico,Helpful Hints,"Deadlines are often little more than (very) general target 
              dates."
Mexico,Helpful Hints,"Note differences in class and status in Mexico, for such 
              differences are important."
Mexico,Helpful Hints,"Little things count. Not saying good-bye, for example, may 
              well offend and adversely affect your relationship to a much 
              greater extent than it would in the United States."
Mexico,Especially for Women,"Women should prepare for some difficulty when doing business 
              in Mexico. Because some Mexican businessmen you encounter may not 
              have had many dealings with women in positions of authority, you 
              should demonstrate your competence, skill and authority."
Mexico,Especially for Women,"Talk and behavior considered sexist and inappropriate in the 
              United States may well have to be endured in Mexico."
Mexico,Especially for Women,"Mexican men, business colleagues included, will pay foreign 
              businesswomen many compliments and may even be flirtatious. 
              Graciously accept such banter -- it is usually done with the 
              utmost respect -- while firmly reminding your male Mexican 
              counterparts that you are a businesswoman."
Mexico,Especially for Women,"Foreign businesswomen should not invite Mexican businessmen to 
              dinner unless their spouses also come along. If invited out to 
              dinner or to socialize by a male Mexican colleague, a 
              businesswoman should make it clear that no opportunity for romance 
              exists. Appearances are important."

Netherlands,Meeting and Greeting,"Shake hands with everyone present -- men, women, and children 
              -- at business and social meetings. Shake hands again when

              Don't be afraid to do so."
Netherlands,Body Language,The Dutch expect eye contact while speaking with someone.
Netherlands,Body Language,"Moving your index finger around your ear means you have a 
              telephone call, not ""you're crazy."" The crazy sign is to tap the 
              center of your forehead with your index finger. This gesture is 
              very rude."
Netherlands,Corporate Culture,"The Dutch take punctuality for business meetings very 
              seriously and expect that you will do likewise; call with an 
              explanation if you are delayed."
Netherlands,Corporate Culture,"Lateness, missed appointments, postponements, changing the 
              time of an appointment or a late delivery deteriorates trust and 
              can ruin relationships."
Netherlands,Corporate Culture,"Exchange business cards during or after conversation. No set 
              ritual exists. Business cards in English are acceptable."

              performance. One-upmanship is frowned upon."

              answers."
Netherlands,Corporate Culture,"The Dutch are conservative and forceful and can be stubborn 
              and tough negotiators. They are willing to innovate or experiment, 
              but with minimal risk."
Netherlands,Corporate Culture,"Companies are frugal and careful with money. Business is 
              profit-oriented with the bottom line being very important. 
              However, the Dutch are not obsessed with numbers."
Netherlands,Corporate Culture,"Strategy is cautious and pragmatic, usually involving 
              step-by-step plans. Preparations are made to improvise the plan, 
              if needed. Strategy is clear and communicated to all levels."
Netherlands,Corporate Culture,"In many companies the decision-making process is slow and 
              ponderous, involving wide consultation. Consensus is vital. The

Netherlands,Corporate Culture,"Once decisions are made, implementation is fast and efficient."
Netherlands,Corporate Culture,"In the Netherlands, commitments are taken seriously and are 
              honored. Do not promise anything or make an offer you are not

              contact, and sayober (waiter) or mevrouw(waitress)."
Netherlands,Dining and Entertainment,"It is appropriate to discuss business during lunch. Business 
              breakfasts are not very common."
Netherlands,Dining and Entertainment,"Most business entertaining is done in restaurants, but the 
              Dutch do a fair amount of entertaining at home as well."
Netherlands,Dining and Entertainment,"The Dutch will make it clear that you are their guest if they 
              intend to pay the bill, otherwise expect to ""go Dutch"" and pay 
              your fair share. No one will be embarrassed at splitting the bill."
Netherlands,Dining and Entertainment,"Spouses are often included in a business dinner. Ask if your

Netherlands,Dining and Entertainment,"Dutch manners are frank -- no-nonsense informality combined 
              with strict adherence to basic etiquette."
Netherlands,Dining and Entertainment,"Food does not play the major role in hospitality that it does 
              in many other cultures. It is not considered essential for making

              an X."
Netherlands,Dining and Entertainment,"It is considered rude to leave the table during dinner (even 
              to go to the bathroom)."

              relationship has developed."

              hostess. Bring children a small gift or candy. Sending flowers 
              before or after the party is also appropriate."
Netherlands,Helpful Hints,"The Dutch avoid superlatives. Compliments are offered 
              sparingly, and to say that something is ""not bad"" is to praise it. 
              A person who never offers criticism is seen as either being 
              simple-minded or failing to tell the truth. A foreigner need not 
              worry too much about saying something the will hurt feelings. The 
              Dutch will argue, but seldom take offense."
Netherlands,Helpful Hints,Dutch humor is subtle rather than slapstick.
Netherlands,Helpful Hints,"The Dutch speak directly and use a lot of eye contact. To a

Norway,Meeting and Greeting,"Norwegians do not use the phrases ""Pleased to meet you"" or

              style in the United States, and employees are asked opinions."
Norway,Corporate Culture,"Consensus is a high priority, but the boss makes the final 
              decisions."
Norway,Dining and Entertainment,"Norwegians insist on punctuality for social occasions. 7:00 
              p.m. means 7:00 p.m."
Norway,Dining and Entertainment,"Business lunches are to discuss business, but business dinners 
              are mostly social. Business can also be discussed, but allow the 
              host to open the discussion."
Norway,Dining and Entertainment,"For a formal toast, look into the eyes of the person being 
              toasted and give a slight nod, then saySkål. Before

              honor tapping his glass with a knife and thanking the hostess on

              small gifts may be appropriate at the successful conclusion of 
              negotiations."
Norway,Gifts,"Keep gifts small. An expensive gift may be viewed as a bribe. 
              Give: brandy or whiskey that are good quality but not too 
              expensive."
Norway,Helpful Hints,"Do not drink and drive. Norway has very strict laws for 
              intoxicated drivers, and the limit for blood/alcohol content is 
              only .05. One beer can put you over the limit."
Norway,Helpful Hints,"Sincerity is very important. Norwegians often consider 
              Americans too glib and too casual. Never invite someone to dinner 
              or suggest ""getting together"" without following with a sincere 
              invitation."

              p.m. Dinner is usually served around 10:00 p.m. and never earlier 
              than 9:00 p.m. Never invite anyone for a 7:00 p.m. dinner, which 
              would be far too early. Invite people at 8:30 or 9:00 p.m., and 
              serve dinner at 10:00 p.m."
Paraguay,Dining and Entertainment,"Lunch is the main meal of the day. Businesspeople and 
              schoolchildren go home at noon to have lunch with their family. It 
              may be followed by an hour-long nap before everyone returns to 
              work and school."
Paraguay,Dining and Entertainment,"Guests are served full plates of food. Show that you enjoy 
              your food. Eat dinner and accept seconds, which will probably be

Philippines,Meeting and Greeting,"Men and women shake hands with everyone present at a business 
              meeting or social occasion and when saying ""goodbye."" Handshakes 
              should be friendly and informal, but limp. Men should wait for 
              women to extend their hand."
Philippines,Body Language,"If Filipinos don't understand a question, they open their 
              mouths. Raised eyebrows signify recognition and agreement."
Philippines,Body Language,"Laughter may convey pleasure or embarrassment; it is commonly 
              used to relieve tension."
Philippines,Body Language,"""Yes"" is signified by a jerk of the head upward. ""No"" is 
              signified by a jerk of the head down. Since the Filipinos rarely 
              say no, the non-verbal sign for ""no"" is sometimes accompanied by a 
              verbal yes, which would still indicate ""no."""
Philippines,Body Language,"Staring is considered rude and could be misinterpreted as a 
              challenge, but Filipinos may stare or even touch foreigners, 
              especially in areas where foreigners are rarely seen."
Philippines,Body Language,"To Filipinos, standing with your hands on your hips means you 
              are angry."

              is an insult."
Philippines,Body Language,"To indicate two of something, raise your ring and pinkie 
              fingers."
Philippines,Body Language,"To beckon, extend arm, palm down, moving fingers in scratching 
              motion. Touch someone's elbow lightly to attract attention. Do not 
              tap on the shoulder."
Philippines,Body Language,"""Eyebrow flash"" -- a quick lifting of eyebrows -- is a 
              Filipino greeting."

Philippines,Corporate Culture,"A personal introduction by a mutual friend or business 
              associate makes business arrangements much smoother."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Establishing a personal relationship is important to the 
              success of a business relationship. Trust and loyalty are central

              can ruin the relationship."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Filipinos often have a ""take it or leave it"" attitude when it 
              comes to selling prices. They may also may place less stress on 
              the absolute selling price and place more emphasis on percentages, 
              unit cost or rounded figures."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Casual conversation may precede business discussions during 
              meetings."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Negotiations and business deals move slowly. A third-party 
              go-between may be a good idea to relieve tension or give 
              criticism. Do not allow meetings to go too long. Filipinos love to 
              eat and their enthusiasm wanes when they are hungry."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Communication is indirect, truth is diplomatically presented, 
              manner is gentle, and the perception of the recipient is 
              considered in all communications. All communication should be 
              courteous, regardless of its content. The Filipino attempt to 
              please may result in many unfinished projects."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Filipinos find it difficult to say ""no,"" disagree, reject or 
              be confrontational, especially when a superior is involved. Expect 
              an ambiguous or indirect answer -- not to deceive, but rather to 
              please and avoid confrontation."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Face-to-face meetings are preferred. Written communications 
              might not be answered. Communication by mail or telephone is 
              unreliable at best."
Philippines,Corporate Culture,"Small bribes are occasionally used to cut through 
              bureaucracies. This is illegal, but done quietly and often. 
              Participate with caution."
Philippines,Dining and Entertainment,"Most business entertaining is done in restaurants or clubs,

Philippines,Dining and Entertainment,"A dinner invitation to counterparts and their spouses is 
              appreciated before you leave the country. Don't bring your spouse 
              to a business lunch. Lunches are generally for business 
              discussions."
Philippines,Dining and Entertainment,"Filipinos may view a dinner/party invitation as just a passing 
              thought. They may answer ""yes,"" but not take an invitation 
              seriously. Phone to re-invite and remind. An R.S.V.P. may not be 
              answered. It must be reiterated to be taken seriously. Don't 
              accept an invitation unless repeated at least three times."

              requests, not demands."
Philippines,Helpful Hints,"Don't be offended by personal questions. These are asked to

Portugal,Especially for Women,"Traditionally, conservative attitudes have prevailed towards 
              women, but there is a strong movement towards Portuguese women 
              being involved in business."
Portugal,Especially for Women,"Going to a bar alone is frowned upon. It may call unwelcome 
              attention."
Portugal,Especially for Women,"It is better for a foreign woman to invite a Portuguese man to 
              a business lunch rather than dinner. If you invite a man to 
              dinner, it is better to ask if he would like to bring his wife."
Portugal,Especially for Women,"The charm of Portuguese men will not allow a woman to pay for 
              a lunch or dinner. It is acceptable to try."

Russia,Meeting and Greeting,"Initial greetings may come across as cool. Do not expect 
              friendly smiles."
Russia,Meeting and Greeting,"A handshake is always appropriate (but not obligatory) when 
              greeting or leaving, regardless of the relationship. Remove your 
              gloves before shaking hands. Don't shake hands over a threshold 
              (Russian folk belief holds that this action will lead to an 
              argument)."
Russia,Body Language,"Russians are a very demonstrative people, and public physical 
              contact is common. Hugs, backslapping, kisses on the cheeks and 
              other expansive gestures are common among friends or acquaintances 
              and between members of the same sex."
Russia,Body Language,Russians stand close when talking.
Russia,Body Language,"Putting your thumb through your index and middle fingers or 
              making the ""OK"" sign are considered very rude gestures in Russia."
Russia,Corporate Culture,"Russians appreciate punctuality. Business meetings generally 
              begin on time."
Russia,Corporate Culture,"Under Communism there were no incentives for bureaucrats to 
              perform well or to even be pleasant toward clients; this meant 
              that the usual answer to any question was ""No."" This practice is 
              still found in Russian society today, but ""No"" is usually not the 
              final word on an issue. One has to bargain and be persistent to 
              get what he or she wants."
Russia,Corporate Culture,"Business cards are handed out liberally in Russia and are 
              always exchanged at business meetings. The ceremony of presenting 
              and receiving business cards is important. Don't treat it lightly."
Russia,Corporate Culture,"Representatives of the Russian company or government body are 
              usually seated on one side of a table at meetings with guests on 
              the other side."
Russia,Corporate Culture,"Your company should be represented by a specialized team of 
              experts. Presentations should be thoroughly prepared, detailed, 
              factual and short on ""salesmanship."""
Russia,Corporate Culture,"Russians usually negotiate technical issues very competently, 
              directly and clearly but, being newcomers to capitalism, often do 
              not fully understand Western business practices and objectives. 
              You may have to explain the reasoning behind some of your demands."
Russia,Corporate Culture,"Russians find it difficult to admit mistakes, especially 
              publicly. They also find it difficult to risk offending someone by 
              making requests or assertions."
Russia,Corporate Culture,"Trying to do business in Russia over the telephone is 
              generally ineffective. The Russian telecommunications system is 
              inadequate, but improving quickly. The telex is widely used."
Russia,Corporate Culture,"Personal relationships play a crucial role in Russian 
              business."
Russia,Corporate Culture,"Business negotiations in Russia are lengthy and may test your 
              patience. Plan to be in for the long haul."
Russia,Corporate Culture,No agreement is final until a contract has been signed.
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"When dining in a restaurant, arrive on time."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"Russians are great hosts and love entertaining guests in their 
              homes. They will often put more food on the table than can be 
              eaten to indicate there is an abundance of food (whether there is 
              or not). Guests who leave food on their plates honor their host. 
              It means they have eaten well."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"If you're invited for dinner, don't make other plans for later 
              in the evening. You are expected to spend time socializing after 
              the meal."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"An invitation to a Russian dacha (country home) is a great 
              honor."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"Do not turn down offers of food or drink. Given Russian 
              hospitality, this can be difficult, but to decline such offers is 
              considered rude."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"At formal functions, guests do not usually start eating until 
              the host has begun. At such functions, no one should leave until 
              the guest of honor has left. If you are the guest of honor, do not 
              stay too late."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"Know your limits when drinking alcohol in Russia. Drinking is 
              often an all-or-nothing affair -- moderation is not understood."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"Toasts, which are sometimes lengthy and occasionally humorous, 
              are common. The host starts and the guests reply. Do not drink 
              until the first toast has been offered."
Russia,Dining and Entertainment,"After a toast, most Russians like to clink their glasses 
              together. Do not do so if you are drinking something 
              non-alcoholic."
Russia,Dress,"A ""serious"" businessperson is expected to look formal and 
              conservative. Wearing very light or bright colors might make you 
              appear lazy or unreliable to a Russian."
Russia,Dress,"Men should wear suits and ties. Women should wear suits and 
              dresses or pantsuits."
Russia,Gifts,"A small business gift is always appropriate, but its value 
              should correspond to the rank of the Russian businessperson with 
              whom you are meeting."
Russia,Gifts,"As a general rule, do not give items that are now easily 
              obtainable in Russia."
Russia,Gifts,"Bring a gift for the hostess when visiting a Russian home. A 
              small gift for a Russian child is always appropriate (and 
              appreciated)."
Russia,Helpful Hints,"Russians are very proud of their culture and enjoy 
              opportunities to talk about their music, art, literature and 
              dance. Knowledge about art, music and some Russian history is 
              appreciated."
Russia,Helpful Hints,"Learn Russian! Learning the language is of incalculable value, 
              and is the best way to win friends for yourself, your company and 
              your country. If that simply isn't possible, try to learn at least 
              a few phrases in Russian. It doesn't have to be perfect; Russians 
              greatly appreciate any attempt by foreigners to speak their 
              language."
Russia,Helpful Hints,"Never refer to a Russian as ""Comrade."""
Russia,Helpful Hints,"Do not expect to find smoke-free areas anywhere. A standard 
              joke among foreign businesspeople in Russia is that Russian 
              buildings have two sections: ""smoking"" and ""chain-smoking."""
Russia,Especially for Women,"Women are initially regarded with skepticism and may have to 
              prove themselves. Before you visit, have a mutually respected 
              colleague send a letter introducing you. Your business cards 
              should clearly state your title and academic degree. If you 
              establish your position and ability immediately, you will 
              encounter far fewer problems."
Russia,Especially for Women,"Be feminine. Allow men to open doors, light cigarettes, etc. 
              Even if you think such customs are antiquated or silly, respect 
              the cultural background of your Russian colleagues."
Russia,Especially for Women,"Foreign businesswomen can use their femininity to their 
              advantage. For fear of not appearing a gentleman, many Russian 
              businessmen may allow foreign businesswomen to get away with some 
              things (requests for meetings, favors, etc.) that foreign 
              businessmen aren't allowed."
Russia,Especially for Women,"A woman can invite a Russian businessman to lunch and pay the 
              bill, although it might be interpreted by some men as an 
              invitation to flirt."

Singapore,Meeting and Greeting,"Shake hands with everyone present at a business meeting or 
              social occasion. Shake hands again when leaving. Your handshake 
              should be firm."
Singapore,Meeting and Greeting,"Singaporeans may bow slightly as they shake your hand. Many 
              Westerners are generally taller than Singaporeans, so it would be 
              polite to give a small bow. A slight bow for Chinese or older 
              people is polite."
Singapore,Body Language,"Never touch a person's or child's head. The head is considered 
              sacred."
Singapore,Body Language,"The foot is considered the lowest part of the body, and is 
              thought to be unclean. The foot should never be used to point at 
              someone, and you should never show the bottom of your feet. 
              Tapping your foot or fidgeting your legs denotes feebleness and 
              lack of interest. When crossing your legs, do so only by placing 
              one knee over the other."
Singapore,Body Language,"Raise your hand to get someone's attention. Never signal or 
              point at a person with the forefinger. Do not pound your first on 
              an open palm; this is obscene. The forearm jerk is a rude gesture."
Singapore,Corporate Culture,"Westerners are expected to be punctual for social occasions 
              and business meetings. Call if you are delayed. Tardiness is 
              viewed as a sign of disrespect."
Singapore,Corporate Culture,"Business cards are exchanged upon being introduced. Exchange 
              business cards with both hands after you are introduced."
Singapore,Corporate Culture,"The government finances many of the large corporations in 
              Singapore. This bureaucratic system is known for its high 
              efficiency and corruption-free business style. Western-style 
              management is evident in large firms managed by Singaporeans."
Singapore,Corporate Culture,"Personal contacts are important in business. It takes several 
              years to develop business relationships. Take time to know people 
              before discussing business."
Singapore,Corporate Culture,"Singaporeans tend to get right down to business in meetings. 
              Singaporeans are fast-paced and can make decisions quickly."
Singapore,Corporate Culture,"You are expected to deliver reports, correspondence, packages, 
              etc. when promised."
Singapore,Corporate Culture,"Always talk straight and get right to the point with 
              Singaporeans. You can be direct when dealing with issues of money."
Singapore,Dining and Entertainment,"Dinner is the most common form of business entertainment, but 
              it is a time to socialize and build relationships rather than 
              discuss business. Don't be surprised if business dinners are 
              scheduled for every night of the week. Most entertainment is done 
              in restaurants."
Singapore,Dining and Entertainment,"Food is usually put on the table with all dishes served at 
              once and to be shared by all. Drinks and appetizers are uncommon, 
              though they are available in Western restaurants."
Singapore,Dining and Entertainment,Allow the host to order all the dishes.
Singapore,Dining and Entertainment,"Chinese may offer a banquet. A Westerner should always 
              reciprocate with a banquet of equal value before departing."
Singapore,Dining and Entertainment,"Chinese use chopsticks for most food and porcelain spoons for 
              the liquid part of soup. Western style utensils are used, but are 
              not as common as chopsticks."
Singapore,Dining and Entertainment,"Allow a Chinese host to invite you to start your meal and 
              begin eating before you start to eat."
Singapore,Dining and Entertainment,"When finished with your meal, place chopsticks on the 
              chopstick rest (setting them on your plate means you are not 
              finished)."
Singapore,Dining and Entertainment,"Be on time for dinner in a Malay home. The dinner is usually 
              served immediately with no drinks or appetizers beforehand."
Singapore,Dining and Entertainment,"Indians always wash their hands before and after a meal. In a 
              Malay home, you will be given a small bowl of water and a towel. 
              Use the water to wash your hands."
Singapore,Dining and Entertainment,"Malays and Indians use a spoon along with their hands to eat, 
              but never use your left hand to eat (unclean). If given a spoon 
              and fork, hold the spoon in your right hand and use your fork 
              (left hand) to push food onto the spoon."
Singapore,Dining and Entertainment,"Never let the serving spoon touch your plate and never share 
              your leftovers. Indians believe that anything that touches 
              someone's plate is tainted."
Singapore,Dining and Entertainment,"It is impolite to refuse initial offers of food or drink. To 
              refuse seconds, place your hand above your plate and say, ""No, 
              thank you."" When finished, place your spoon and fork together on 
              your plate. If they are not placed together, you will be offered 
              more food."
Singapore,Dining and Entertainment,"After a meal with Indians, expect to stay for approximately 
              one hour of conversation."
Singapore,Dress,"Due to different ethnic groups and the modern character of 
              Singaporeans, there are many different attires acceptable. Dress 
              is normally very casual. Western clothing is most common."
Singapore,Dress,"For business, men should wear white shirts, tie and slacks. 
              Jackets are usually not required."
Singapore,Dress,"Women should wear blouses with sleeves and skirts or 
              pantsuits."
Singapore,Gifts,Each ethnic group shares different gift giving traditions.
Singapore,Gifts,Business gifts are generally not exchanged.
Singapore,Gifts,"Use both hands to give someone a gift. A gift given to a guest 
              or the host is not opened in the presence of the giver."
Singapore,Gifts,"Be careful of the gift being misinterpreted as a bribe, even a 
              small gift. Never give a government official a gift, which might 
              be considered a bribe."
Singapore,Gifts,Always bring the hosts a gift when invited to someone's home.
Singapore,Helpful Hints,"Singapore has strict regulations which carry stiff fines, 
              possible jail sentences or even death. You should never do the 
              following: jaywalk; smoke in public or in air-conditioned 
              buildings (except country clubs); enter the country with drugs; 
              litter, or import, manufacture, sell or use chewing gum."
Singapore,Helpful Hints,Avoid public displays of affection.
Singapore,Helpful Hints,"Do not show anger or emotions or raise your voice. Remain 
              disciplined and in control."
Singapore,Helpful Hints,Avoid discussing religion or politics.
Singapore,Helpful Hints,"Avoid jokes until you know someone well. Few jokes will be 
              understood or appreciated."
Singapore,Especially for Women,"Western women may confront a small bias when doing business in 
              Singapore. Being taller than Singaporeans may be advantageous to 
              women."
Singapore,Especially for Women,"Singapore has an official policy against discrimination of 
              women, and Singaporean women are gaining a wider acceptance in

South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"The bow is the traditional Korean greeting, although it is 
              often accompanied by a handshake among men. To show respect when 
              shaking hands, support your right forearm with your left hand."
South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"Korean women usually nod slightly and will not shake hands 
              with Western men. Western women may offer their hand to a Korean 
              man."
South Korea,Meeting and Greeting,"Bow when departing. Younger people wave (move their arm from 
              side to side)."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"It is considered very impolite to address a Korean with his or 
              her given name. Address Koreans using appropriate professional 
              titles until specifically invited by your host or colleagues to 
              use their given names."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Americans should address a Korean with Mr., Mrs., Miss + 
              family name; however, never address a high-ranking person or 
              superior in this manner."
South Korea,Names and Titles,"Korean names are the opposite of Western names with the family 
              name first, followed by the two-part given name. The first of the 
              two given names is shared by everyone of the same generation in 
              the family, and the second is the individual's given name. 
              Example: Lee (Family) + Dong (Shared Given) + Sung (Given). Dong 
              Sung is the individual's given name. Address him as Mr. Lee or Lee 
              Sonsaengnim (which means ""teacher"")."
South Korea,Body Language,"Koreans consider it a personal violation to be touched by 
              someone who is not a relative or close friend. Avoid touching, 
              patting or back slapping a Korean."
South Korea,Body Language,"Direct eye contact between junior and senior businesspeople 
              should be avoided. This is seen as impolite or even as a 
              challenge."
South Korea,Body Language,"Do not cross your legs or stretch your legs out straight in 
              front of you. Keep your feet on the floor, never on a desk or 
              chair."
South Korea,Body Language,"Always pass and receive objects with your right hand 
              (supported by the left hand at the wrist or forearm) or with two 
              hands."
South Korea,Body Language,"To beckon someone, extend your arm, palm down, and move your 
              fingers in a scratching motion. Never point with your index 
              finger."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Koreans expect Westerners to be punctual for social occasions 
              and business meetings. Call if you will be delayed. However, you 
              may be kept waiting up to a half hour. This is not a sign of 
              disrespect, but reflects the pressure of time on Korean 
              executives."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Professionals meeting for the first time usually exchange 
              business cards. Present your card and receive your colleague's 
              card with both hands."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Building trust and relationships is vital to establishing a 
              successful business relationship. This requires patience. Koreans 
              prefer to do business with people they know."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"The first meeting is to establish trust, so business should 
              not be discussed. Be formal in meetings until the Korean 
              delegation loosens up."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Negotiations are generally long and require several trips. Be 
              prepared for business meetings to go well beyond business hours."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"Koreans generally start negotiations at an unreasonable 
              position and prepare to compromise. Koreans are tough negotiators 
              and admire a firm, persistent negotiator, but refrain from being 
              too aggressive."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"A low, deep bow from Koreans at the end of a meeting indicates 
              a successful meeting. A quick, short parting bow could mean 
              dissatisfaction with meetings. Send a meeting review outlining all 
              discussions and agreements to your Korean counterpart after you 
              leave Korea. Make several visits during negotiations and after 
              business is established."
South Korea,Corporate Culture,"""Yes"" is not necessarily “yes.” Koreans avoid saying ""no."" Try 
              to phrase questions in a manner that doesn't require a ""yes"" or 
              ""no"" answer. Example: Instead of saying ""Could we sign the 
              agreement by next Friday?” say ""When is the earliest date that we 
              could expect to sign this agreement?"""
South Korea,Dining and Entertainment,"Sharing a dinner is vital to building friendships that foster 
              trust. Your business success is directly related to your social 
              relationships."
South Korea,Dining and Entertainment,"Do not pour your own drink, but do offer to pour others'. It 
              is common to trade and fill each other's cup. To refuse is an 
              insult. Women pour men's drinks, but never another woman's drink. 
              A woman may pour her own drink. Leave some drink in your glass if 
              you don't want a refill."
South Korea,Dining and Entertainment,"Wherever you see a ""No Tipping"" sign, do not tip. Koreans find 
              tipping offensive, although tipping is now becoming expected in 
              Western hotels."
South Korea,Dining and Entertainment,"Always allow your host to seat you. The seat of honor is the 
              seat looking at the front door. If you are seated in the seat of 
              honor, it is polite to protest slightly."
South Korea,Dining and Entertainment,"Koreans do not like to talk a lot during dinner. Periods of 
              silence are common and appreciated at a dinner. The meal usually 
              comes before socializing at a dinner party."
South Korea,Dining and Entertainment,"It is polite to pass or accept food or drink with your right 
              hand while your left hand supports your forearm/wrist."
South Korea,Dining and Entertainment,"The person who invites pays the bill for everyone. However, it 
              is polite to offer to pay. When two people are dining, usually the 
              younger person pays for the older person."
South Korea,Dining and Entertainment,"Prepare to sing a solo number after dinner, no matter what 
              kind of voice you have. Any song is acceptable, as long as you 
              sing with spirit."
South Korea,Dining and Entertainment,"After dinner, the host may invite his guests to go drinking. 
              Don't refuse this invitation."
South Korea,Dress,"Koreans dress well, and you should dress accordingly to show 
              respect for them. A formal suit and tie is almost always 
              appropriate. Koreans dress up for city activities, especially in 
              Seoul."
South Korea,Dress,"Women dress modestly. Prepare to sit on the floor; avoid 
              straight, tight skirts."
South Korea,Gifts,"Gift giving is very common in Korea. Offer and receive a gift 
              with both hands. Wrapped gifts are never opened in the presence of 
              the giver."
South Korea,Gifts,"Reciprocate with a gift of similar value when receiving a gift 
              from your Korean colleague. Koreans like regional United States 
              gifts and Indian/Western artifacts."
South Korea,Gifts,"Wrap your gift nicely. Bright colors are preferred for 
              wrapping gifts. Yellow and red or green stripes are a traditional 
              Korean wrapping paper design. Avoid wrapping gifts in dark colors

              your chances of success."

              as twenty courses at a banquet. Business entertainment can last

              bottom of the glass."
Taiwan,Dining and Entertainment,"The glass should be drained after the toast. Turn your glass 
              upside down to show you have drunk the entire contents."
Taiwan,Dining and Entertainment,"If your Taiwan hosts drink a toast to you and pass you an 
              empty glass, it will be filled by one of the hosts. You are 
              expected to toast your hosts and drink the contents of the glass."

              hours."
Taiwan,Dining and Entertainment,"The guest of honor samples any dish brought to the table

              their fingers."

              not provided for this purpose, place them on the table."
Taiwan,Dining and Entertainment,A belch may be considered a compliment at the end of a meal.
Taiwan,Dining and Entertainment,"Tea is served at the end of the meal. This signals the end of 
              the party. Leave even if your host, out of politeness, invites you 
              to stay longer."
Taiwan,Dining and Entertainment,"The host (person who invites) always pays the bill. It is 
              polite for the guest to offer to pay, but don't insist."

Thailand,Meeting and Greeting,"When being introduced or greeting someone, men say 
              Sawatdee-krap and women say Sawatdee-kah."
Thailand,Meeting and Greeting,"Thais greet each other with a ""wai."" Foreigners are not 
              expected to initiate the wai gesture, but it is an insult not to 
              return the wai. If a wai is not offered to you, shake hands with 
              men and smile and nod to women. A Thai businessperson may shake 
              hands with a foreigner. Offer a wai only to a person of equal or 
              greater status. Subordinates should offer a wai first."
Thailand,Meeting and Greeting,"Wai (why) - a person places the palm of his or her hands 
              together, with their fingers extended at chest level close to 
              their body and bows slightly. The higher the hands are placed, the 
              more respect is shown. Subordinates might raise their fingers as 
              high as their nose. However, the tips of their fingers should 
              never be above eye level."
Thailand,Meeting and Greeting,"A wai can mean ""Hello,"" ""Thank you,"" ""I'm sorry,"" or 
              ""Goodbye."" A wai is not used to greet children, servants, street 
              vendors or laborers. Never return a wai to a child, waiter, clerk, 
              etc. Simply nod and smile in response."
Thailand,Meeting and Greeting,Monks do not return a wai.
Thailand,Meeting and Greeting,"Thais say ""Where are you going"" rather than ""Hello."" A polite 
              response is ""Just down the street."""
Thailand,Meeting and Greeting,"Introductions are common only in a formal situation. Introduce 
              yourself by your first name. Feel free to introduce yourself or 
              ask for someone's name. When introducing your business partner to 
              an important Thai, mention your partner's name first."
Thailand,Meeting and Greeting,"The inferior or lower-status person is always addressed first 
              in an introduction. Thus, a child is introduced before its 
              parents, a secretary is introduced before her boss."
Thailand,Names and Titles,"Thais address one another by first names and titles and 
              reserve last names for very formal occasions and written 
              communications. Last names have been used in Thailand for only the 
              past fifty years and are difficult even for Thais to pronounce. 
              Two people with the same last name are almost certainly related."
Thailand,Names and Titles,"Foreigners are often addressed by their given names because it 
              is easier for Thais; it does not imply familiarity. Thais will 
              probably call you Mr. Joe or Mrs. Mary."
Thailand,Names and Titles,"Titles, rank and honor are very important. Introductions 
              require only the given name and title. Mr., Mrs., or Miss + family 
              name are appropriate for visitors to use in formal situations."
Thailand,Names and Titles,"Thai given names are preceded by Khun (Mr. Mrs. or Miss), 
              unless they carry a higher degree, such as doctor. Khun is used 
              for men and women, married or single. If you don't know a person's 
              name, address them as Khun. Example: Anuwat (Given) + 
              Wattapongsiri (Family) is Khun Anuwat."
Thailand,Names and Titles,"Correspondence: Use Dear + Khun + given name. Example: Dear 
              Khun Mary."
Thailand,Names and Titles,Nicknames are common in Thailand
Thailand,Corporate Culture,"Thailand has a pro-business attitude. Business decisions are 
              slow. Decisions pass through many levels before being decided 
              upon. Planning is short-term. Top management is often family. Who 
              you know is important. Powerful connections are respected."
Thailand,Corporate Culture,"First meetings generally produce good humor, many smiles, 
              polite conversation and few results. The second meeting should 
              include a meal invitation. Meetings begin with small talk. 
              Discussing business before becoming acquainted is impolite. 
              Degrees, especially from prestigious universities, bring status. 
              Thais may list these on their business card. Thais respect 
              foreigners with powerful connections."
Thailand,Corporate Culture,"Negotiations may be lengthy. Process takes precedence over 
              content. Slow information flow may delay discussions and 
              decisions."
Thailand,Corporate Culture,"Thais prefer to work later in the evening rather than early in 
              the morning. Business is kept separate from work. Family comes 
              first before business."
Thailand,Corporate Culture,"Frankness is not appreciated. Be subtle in responding with a 
              negative reply."
Thailand,Body Language,"Touching between people of the same sex is more common in 
              Thailand than in many other Asian countries. However, touching 
              someone of the opposite sex is taboo. Do not show affection in 
              public."
Thailand,Body Language,"Never touch or pass anything over anyone's head. The head is 
              considered sacred in Thailand and must be respected."

              symbolically (as well as physically) the lowest part of the body."
Thailand,Body Language,"Do not put your hands in your pockets while talking to 
              someone. Never put your arm over the back of the chair in which 
              someone is sitting."
Thailand,Body Language,"A smile is often used for many different emotions. It may be 
              an apology, a thank-you, a greeting, or to show embarrassment. Be 
              aware: A Thai's smiling assurance does not mean you will in fact 
              get what you want, when you want it. It simply reflects the Thai 
              appreciation of harmony and their ""never mind"" attitude."
Thailand,Body Language,"Don't wave your hands about as you talk, giving Thais the 
              impression that you are angry. Never pass anything with your left 
              hand. Never point with your hand and never, never with one finger."
Thailand,Body Language,"Do not cross your legs in the presence of the elderly or 
              monks."
Thailand,Body Language,"To beckon someone, extend your arm with the palm of your hand 
              down and flutter your fingers up and down."
Thailand,Dining and Entertainment,"To attract a waiter, wave quietly with your palm down or say 
              ""Nong"" (brother or sister). Never snap your fingers or raise your 
              voice to attract a waiter."
Thailand,Dining and Entertainment,"Thai food is eaten with a fork and a tablespoon rather than 
              with chopsticks. The spoon is held in the right hand and the 
              bottom of the fork pushes the food into the spoon."
Thailand,Dining and Entertainment,"All Western hotels serve Western and continental cuisine for 
              all meals."

              before eating."
Thailand,Dining and Entertainment,"Many Thai dishes are hot and spicy with herbs, lemon grass, 
              and coriander, but most are not especially aggressive. Food is

              has its own specialties."
Thailand,Dining and Entertainment,"Food may be transferred to your rice bowl, where it can be 
              mixed with rice. Rice is eaten with almost every meal."
Thailand,Dining and Entertainment,"Leave a small amount of food on your plate when you have 
              finished eating, to show you are full. Place your spoon and fork 
              on your plate at the 5:25 position to indicate you are finished 
              eating."
Thailand,Dining and Entertainment,"The host pays the bill. Never offer to split a bill in a 
              restaurant."
Thailand,Dress,"Thai society is divided into upper and lower classes. At 
              formal occasions, dress is expected to match one's social station. 
              Appearance is very important. Wealth is greatly admired. 
              High-status Thais often overdress, especially considering the hot 
              climate."
Thailand,Dress,"Western clothing is very common. Modest clothing is 
              recommended. General dress is informal but always neat and clean. 
              Clothing should be stylish and cool."
Thailand,Dress,"For Businessmen: Pants and shirts (white or colored) with or 
              without a tie. A light suit or jacket adds status. In the evening,

              Senior executives wear light weight suits to work."
Thailand,Dress,"For Businesswomen: Conservative dresses or skirts and blouses

              bill."
United Kingdom,Dining and Entertainment,"A British business associate may invite you to watch cricket 
              or to the regatta. Both are prestigious events. Wear your tweed

United States,Meeting and Greeting,"American greetings are generally quite informal. This is not 
              intended to show lack of respect, but rather a manifestation of 
              the American belief that everyone is equal."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Although it is expected in business situations, some Americans 
              do not shake hands at social events. Instead, they may greet you 
              with a casual ""Hello"" or ""How are you?"" or even just ""Hi."" In 
              larger groups, many may not greet you at all. In social 
              situations, Americans rarely shake hands upon leaving."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"The only proper answers to the greetings ""How do you do?"" ""How 
              are you?"" or ""How are you doing?"" are ""Fine,"" ""Great,"" or ""Very 
              well, thank you."" This is not a request for information about your 
              well-being; it is simply a pleasantry."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"""See you later"" is just an expression. People say this even if 
              they never plan to see you again."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"When saying good-bye, Americans may say ""We'll have to get 
              together"" or ""Let's do lunch."" This is simply a friendly gesture. 
              Unless your American colleague specifies a time and date, don't 
              expect an invitation. If you want to have lunch, you should take 
              the initiative to schedule it."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Stand while being introduced. Only the elderly, the ill and 
              physically unable persons remain seated while greeting or being 
              introduced."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"It is good to include some information about a person you are 
              introducing. Example: ""Susan Olson, I'd like you to meet John 
              Harmon. He designed the brochure we are using for this campaign."""
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Use professional titles when you are introducing people to 
              each other. Example: ""Judge Susan Olson, meet Dr. John Harmon."" If 
              you are introducing yourself, do not use your professional title."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,"Handshakes are usually brief. Light handshakes are considered 
              distasteful. Use a firm grip."
United States,Meeting and Greeting,Eye contact is important when shaking someone’s hand.
United States,Body Language,"Keep your distance when conversing. If an American feels you 
              are standing too close, he or she may step back without even 
              thinking about it."
United States,Body Language,"People who like to touch really like touching, and people who 
              do not like to touch really dislike being touched. You will need 
              to watch your colleagues for clues on what they are comfortable 
              with."
United States,Body Language,"Americans are generally uncomfortable with same-sex touching, 
              especially between males."
United States,Body Language,"Holding the middle finger up by itself is considered insulting 
              and vulgar."
United States,Body Language,"Americans smile a great deal, even at strangers. They like to 
              have their smiles returned."
United States,Body Language,"Men and women will sit with legs crossed at the ankles or 
              knees, or one ankle crossed on the knee."
United States,Body Language,"Some Americans are known as ""back slappers"" -- they give 
              others a light slap on the back to show friendship."
United States,Corporate Culture,"In a country that prides itself on its individualism, companies 
            are organized and structured with many different styles depending on 
            the industry, the company's history and its current leaders. In the 
            United States, business relationships are formed between companies 
            rather than between people. Americans do business where they get the 
            best deal and the best service. It is not important to develop a 
            personal relationship in order to establish a long and successful 
            business relationship."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans view the business card as a source of future 
              information and tend to exchange cards casually. There is no set 
              ritual for exchanging business cards."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans prefer directness in communication. When Americans 
              say ""yes"" or ""no,"" they mean precisely that. ""Maybe"" really does 
              mean ""it might happen""; it does not mean ""no."""
United States,Corporate Culture,"It is always proper to ask questions if you do not understand 
              something. Americans ask questions -- lots of them. They are not 
              ashamed to admit what they do know. Americans will assume you 
              understand something if you do not tell them otherwise."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans are often uncomfortable with silence. Silence is 
              avoided in social or business meetings."
United States,Corporate Culture,"It is rude to interrupt someone who is talking. Say, ""Excuse 
              me"" during a pause and wait to be recognized. Interruptions, 
              however, are common. Do not be surprised if someone finishes your 
              sentence if you hesitate when you are speaking."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans put a great deal of value on the written word. 
              American law almost always requires contracts to be written out. 
              Verbal contracts are rarely legally binding. Make sure you read 
              the fine print."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Do not enter into any contract without hiring a lawyer. No 
              savvy American businessperson would dream of signing a contract 
              before consulting a lawyer."
United States,Corporate Culture,"It is very important in written communication to spell names 
              correctly and have correct titles. If you are unsure of these, 
              call the person's assistant to get the correct spelling and title."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Keep appointments once they are made. You may not get a second 
              chance if you do not."
United States,Corporate Culture,"When you are doing business in the United States, you must be 
              on time. Americans view someone being late as rude, showing a lack 
              of respect and having sloppy, undisciplined personal habits."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Being ""on time"" in business situations generally means being 
              about five minutes early. Five minutes late is acceptable with a 
              brief apology. Ten to fifteen minutes late requires a phone call 
              to warn of the delay and to apologize."
United States,Corporate Culture,"It is very important to meet deadlines. If you tell someone 
              that you will have a report to them by a certain date, or that you 
              will fax something to them immediately, they will take you at your 
              word. People who miss deadlines are viewed as irresponsible and 
              undependable."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Meetings are generally informal and relaxed in manner, but 
              serious in content. Often an agenda will be distributed before a 
              meeting, so the participants will be prepared to discuss certain 
              topics. A successful meeting is short and to the point. Be 
              prepared to begin business immediately, with little or no prior 
              small talk."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Participation is expected in meetings. A quiet person may be 
              viewed as not prepared or as having nothing important to 
              contribute."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Meetings often end with a summary and an action plan for the 
              participants to execute. A meeting is only considered successful 
              if something concrete is decided."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans appreciate and are impressed by numbers. Using 
              statistics to support your opinions will help you be persuasive."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Generally, there is one negotiation leader who has the 
              authority to make decisions. Team negotiations are rare. Americans 
              may begin negotiations with unacceptable conditions or demands. 
              They are usually taking a starting position that gives them room 
              to bargain."
United States,Corporate Culture,"The goal of most negotiations in the United States is to 
              arrive at a signed contract. Long-term relationships and benefits 
              may not be the main objective. The immediate deal may be the only 
              important issue."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Negotiations may seem rushed to you. Remember that ""time is 
              money"" to Americans and that they may not think that building a 
              relationship with potential business partners is necessary."
United States,Corporate Culture,"Americans are very comfortable picking up the telephone and 
              immediately conducting business with someone they have never met 
              and perhaps never will meet."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"Americans conduct business over breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
              Some socializing may start off the meal, but often the 
              conversation will revolve around business."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"In a business setting the person extending the invitation to a 
              meal pays for it."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"The fork is held in the left hand, tines facing down. The 
              knife is held in the right hand. After cutting the food, the knife 
              is laid down and the fork is switched to the right hand to eat the 
              cut food. Continental style (where the fork stays in the left hand 
              to eat the cut food) is perfectly acceptable."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"The guest of honor is often toasted and should reciprocate by 
              giving a toast of thanks."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"Your napkin should be placed on your lap shortly after you are 
              seated and kept on your lap at all times during the meal. Do not 
              tuck your napkin under your chin."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"Raise your hand or index finger and make eye contact to signal 
              a server."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,Dinner at an American home may be fairly informal.
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"Do not be late for a dinner party. Arrive within 5 to 15 
              minutes after the time on the invitation. Never arrive before the 
              time you were invited. If you are going to be more than 15 minutes 
              late, phone your hosts and apologize."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"Never begin eating until everyone is served and your hosts 
              have begun. Offer food or drink to others before helping yourself. 
              Serve all women at the table first."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"If offered a second helping of food, feel free to take what 
              you like. Americans like people to eat a lot."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"When you are invited to an event, it is very important to call 
              or drop a note letting the host know if you will attend. That 
              said, Americans are notorious for not responding to invitations."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"Do not be afraid of hurting someone's feelings by responding 
              ""no"" to an invitation. People will be offended if you say you will 
              attend and then do not come."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"If an invitation reads ""6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.,"" leave very 
              close to the ending time stated."
United States,Dining and Entertainment,"Americans tend to eat more quickly than people from other 
              countries. Dining in the United States is seldom the long, 
              lingering event it is in much of the world. The point is more 
              often to eat rather than socialize and savor the meal."
United States,Dress,"The appropriate clothing for business varies widely. Proper dress 
            depends on the region of the country, a person's company, his or her 
            position within it and the industry in which he or she works. The 
            best approach is to be conservative until you have had a chance to 
            observe what others wear in an office. You can always get more 
            casual after you get a sense of how people dress. You cannot lose, 
            however, if you begin with a very professional attire and manner."
United States,Dress,"Men: socks should match your suit. No leg should show between 
              pant hem and shoe. Remove your hat when indoors."
United States,Dress,"Women: do not overdress for daytime or wear flashy or noisy 
              jewelry. American women do not wear a lot of makeup to the office. 
              Low-cut blouses, short skirts and tight clothing are not 
              appropriate office attire."
United States,Gifts,"Americans do not have as many customs and taboos concerning 
              gifts as many other cultures have."
United States,Gifts,"Gifts from your country will always be appreciated. Good 
              choices are local and regional arts and crafts, books, candies, 
              specialty foods and wine or spirits (if you are certain that the 
              recipient drinks)."
United States,Gifts,"If you are invited to someone's home for dinner or a party, 
              bring flowers, a potted plant, a fruit basket, candy, wine, a book 
              or a small household gift."
United States,Gifts,"Many companies have policies that discourage their employees 
              from giving or receiving gifts. Most government employees are not 
              allowed to accept gifts. Do not be offended if someone cannot 
              accept a gift."
United States,Gifts,Cash gifts are never appropriate.
United States,Helpful Hints,"It is considered rude to stare, ask questions or otherwise 
              bring attention to someone's disability."
United States,Helpful Hints,"Smoking is very unpopular in the United States. Restaurants 
              have separate smoking and nonsmoking sections. Public and private 
              buildings may ban smoking except in designated areas. Some people 
              do not allow smoking in their homes and will ask you to go outside 
              if you want to have a cigarette. Never smoke anywhere without 
              asking permission from everyone present."
United States,Helpful Hints,"Names are not held as sacred in the United States. Someone may 
              mispronounce your name and laugh a bit as they do it. Or someone 
              may just call you by your given name if your family name is too 
              difficult to pronounce."
United States,Helpful Hints,"There are several common names and nicknames that are used by 
              both men and women. Call the person's assistant to ask if you are 
              unsure of his or her gender."
United States,Helpful Hints,"""Please"" and ""thank you"" are very important in the United 
              States. Say ""please"" and ""thank you"" to everyone for even the 
              smallest kindness. Americans say them regardless of rank or how 
              much they are paying for something, and they expect others to do 
              the same."
United States,Helpful Hints,"Say ""Pardon me"" or ""Excuse me"" if you touch someone or even 
              get close to someone. Americans also say this if they sneeze or 
              cough or do not understand something someone has said."
United States,Helpful Hints,"Americans often share things in casual conversation, even with 
              strangers, that may seem shockingly private."
United States,Helpful Hints,"Social conversation in the United States is light. There is a 
              standard format for small talk. People ask brief questions and 
              expect brief answers. Americans become uncomfortable when one 
              person talks for any length of time in a social situation."
United States,Helpful Hints,"If you feel uncomfortable with a question asked of you, simply 
              smile and say, ""In my country, that would be a strange question."""
United States,American Women,"Women are leaders in all aspects of American life from 
              business to education to government. Never assume that a working 
              woman is in a subordinate position."
United States,American Women,"American women are independent. They will not appreciate any 
              ""special help"" offered because of their gender. Do not assume that 
              a woman needs more time or more help than a man doing the same 
              job."
United States,American Women,"American women pride themselves on the number of 
              responsibilities they take on. Do not assume that a working woman 
              is no longer the primary caretaker of her family and children."
United States,American Women,"When addressing a woman, use the title ""Ms."" unless you know 
              that she prefers ""Mrs."" or ""Miss."""
United States,American Women,"Many women keep their maiden names after marriage. Some use 
              both their maiden and married names."

              whether it is a man or a woman."
United States,American Women,"Do not touch a woman in a business setting except to shake her

Vietnam,Meeting and Greeting,"The Vietnamese generally shake hands both when greeting and 
              when saying good-bye. Shake with both hands, and bow your head 
              slightly to show respect. Bow to the elderly who do not extend 
              their hand. Vietnamese women are more inclined to bow their head 
              slightly than to shake hands."
Vietnam,Meeting and Greeting,"When greeting someone, say “xin chao” (seen chow) + given name 
              + title. The Vietnamese are delighted if a Westerner can properly 
              say “xin chao” (because Vietnamese is a tonal language, “xin chao” 
              can have six different meanings, only one of which is ""Hello"")."
Vietnam,Body Language,"Summoning someone with a curled index finger, as is done in 
              the West, is only done by the boss. To beckon someone, extend your 
              arm, palm down, and move your fingers in a scratching motion. Only 
              beckon someone who has a ""lower"" status than you."
Vietnam,Body Language,"Men and women do not show affection in public. However, 
              members of the same sex may hold hands while walking."
Vietnam,Body Language,"Always use both hands when passing an object to another 
              person."
Vietnam,Body Language,"Touching children on the head is only done by parents, 
              grandparents, etc."
Vietnam,Corporate Culture,"Business cards are usually exchanged when meeting for the 
              first time. Give and receive a business card with both hands."
Vietnam,Corporate Culture,"The Vietnamese are generally quite punctual and expect 
              foreigners to be the same. That said, the Vietnamese can be very 
              flexible and accommodating when situations occur that are beyond 
              the control of one of the parties involved (for example, a 
              washed-out street, traffic jam, etc.)."
Vietnam,Corporate Culture,"Few Vietnamese speak English well. An interpreter is usually 
              necessary."
Vietnam,Corporate Culture,"A foreigner doing business in Vietnam will have to deal with 
              government officials. You may have to go through the same slow 
              procedure dozens of times to obtain the necessary permits to 
              operate a foreign-owned company in Vietnam. Continual, direct 
              contact with the ministry officials responsible for granting or 
              approving your permits and licenses is very important. 
              Difficulties may arise when one official refuses to honor an 
              agreement concluded by another official."
Vietnam,Corporate Culture,"Most decisions are made by committee in Vietnam. Individual 
              connections are not as important as in many other Asian countries, 
              because no one holds absolute power to make a decision. You can 
              not rely on one person in a particular organization to safeguard 
              your interests."
Vietnam,Corporate Culture,"The Vietnamese willingness to avoid unpleasantness can 
              sometimes lead to great misunderstandings. ""Yes"" may not mean 
              ""yes."" When the Vietnamese say ""No problem,"" you can take it to 
              mean ""Yes, there is a problem."" Double and even triple-check all 
              commitments, and then monitor them closely."
Vietnam,Corporate Culture,"Your local partner in Vietnam is very important and should be 
              chosen very carefully."
Vietnam,Corporate Culture,"Corruption is widespread. All manners of payoffs, kickbacks 
              and ""gifts"" are quite common. Be aware that corruption will not 
              only affect your costs, but also may contribute to unexpected 
              delays in delivery and the processing of licenses."
Vietnam,Dining and Entertainment,"A small dish or shaker of white crystal on the table is more 
              likely to be monosodium glutamate (MSG) than sugar or salt."
Vietnam,Dining and Entertainment,"The Vietnamese style of dining is chopsticks and rice bowls. 
              Hold your rice bowl in your hand; it is considered lazy to eat 
              from a rice bowl that is on the table."
Vietnam,Dining and Entertainment,"The host may serve guests, but will usually just invite 
              everyone to begin helping themselves. Food is placed on dishes in 
              the center of the table from which each person helps him/herself."
Vietnam,Dining and Entertainment,"An offer of tea at a reception or meeting is a ritual form of 
              hospitality and should not be refused."
Vietnam,Dress,The Vietnamese dress very well.
Vietnam,Dress,"For business, men should wear conservative but casual suits 
              and ties."
Vietnam,Dress,"Women should wear a conservative dress or a businesslike 
              blouse and pants."
Vietnam,Gifts,Flowers are normally given only by men to women.
Vietnam,Gifts,Always wrap a gift in colorful paper.
Vietnam,Gifts,"When visiting a Vietnamese home, bring a gift for the hostess. 
              A gift for children or an elderly parent is also appreciated."
Vietnam,Gifts,"Give items useful for daily activity, like designer soaps, 
              cosmetics, lamps or framed pictures for the home."
Vietnam,Gifts,"Don't give handkerchiefs (symbols of a sad farewell). Most 
              Asians consider the Western habit of using a cloth handkerchief 
              and then returning it to your pocket to be barbaric."
Vietnam,Gifts,"In business, give whiskey. Giving a gift in an office setting 
              may be misinterpreted as a bribe. Try to save your business gift 
              giving until you are invited to your colleague's home."
Vietnam,Helpful Hints,"Walk quickly, and avoid eye contact on the street."
Vietnam,Helpful Hints,"Refer to Ho Chi Minh City as Saigon. Local people prefer 
              Saigon to Ho Chi Minh City, which was imposed by the government in 
              Hanoi."
Vietnam,Especially for Women,"In the major cities, little sexual discrimination exists, and 
              Vietnamese women receive equal pay for equal work. In the country, 
              men are still boss."
Vietnam,Especially for Women,"Western women should dress conservatively in Vietnam. Women 
              who wear heavy makeup and revealing clothing are viewed as 
              prostitutes."
Vietnam,Especially for Women,"When dining with a Vietnamese man, a western businesswoman 
              should arrange to eat in a public place and should insist upon 
              hosting. If the Vietnamese man hosts, the Western woman is obliged 
              to reciprocate with a meal of equal value."

Argentina,The People,"Argentines are very proud of their country and culture. They are 
            well-educated and sophisticated and like to be viewed as 
            cosmopolitan and progressive. Because 85% of Argentina’s population 
            hails from Italy, Spain, Austria, France, Germany, Great Britain, 
            Portugal, Russia, Switzerland, Poland and the Middle East, 
            Argentines tend to identify with Europeans. It has been said that 
            Argentines are a nation of Italians who speak Spanish and think 
            they’re British living in Paris. Predominantly Catholic (93%), 
            families are highly valued and hold conservative values."
Australia,The People,"Home to nearly five million immigrants from 160 countries, 
            Australia is rich in cultural diversity. Australians, or ""Aussies,"" 
            enjoy an easy-going lifestyle and are generally friendly and 
            relaxed. Modesty and equality are valued."
Austria,The People,"Austrians are proud of their contributions to world civilization. 
            They see themselves as modern, liberal and cultured. Austrians have 
            a great love for the outdoors (i.e., walking, skiing, climbing, 
            etc.). Although predominantly Catholic (89%), traditional family 
            values have been weakened by modern life and government legislation. 
            The rate of women working outside the home is one of the highest in 
            the industrialized world."
Belgium,The People,"Belgium is comprised of two primary cultural groups. The 
            Dutch-speaking Flemings live in Flanders, in the north, and make up 
            55% of the population. The French-speaking Walloons live in 
            Wallonia, in the south, and make up 33% of the population. Hard work 
            and an appreciation for culture are important values to Belgians, 
            who think of themselves as Europeans first, Walloons or Flemings 
            second, and Belgians third. Strong family systems are vital to 
            Belgian society. Extended families live in separate homes, but often 
            settle in or near the town where they were raised."
Bolivia,The People,"Bolivians are very proud of being one of the few countries that 
            have successfully promoted multicultural integration. Vice President 
            Víctor Hugo Cárdenas, elected in 1993, was the first indigenous 
            person elected to this high office in South America. Bolivians are 
            kind, gentle people, who are concerned for each other's welfare. 
            Friendship is a very important value. The family is the central unit 
            in the social system. Education is valued, but still not achievable 
            for all people. Although it is legally compulsory for ages six to 
            14, fewer than half of all children finish primary education."
Brazil,The People,"Brazilians are friendly and free-spirited, with an incredible 
            zest for life. They are very risk-oriented and very creative. 
            Predominantly Roman Catholic (73%), families are large and often 
            include extended family members. Family, educational and 
            socioeconomic backgrounds are important to Brazilians."
Canada,The People,"The vast majority of Canadians claim European ancestry. Four in 
            nine Canadians claim some British ancestry and a little less than 
            one in three have some French ancestry. Eighty percent of the 
            residents in Quebec have French ancestry. Eighty percent of native 
            French speakers live in Quebec (the others are mostly in New 
            Brunswick, and parts of Ontario and Manitoba). Other European groups 
            include Italians, Germans and Ukrainians (especially in the prairie 
            states)."
Chile,The People,"Chileans are very nationalistic and are proud of their country, 
            as well as of their literacy -- the 95% rate puts them among the 
            best educated in the world. Predominantly Roman Catholic (89%), 
            family is the primary structure of society. The father is still 
            considered the head of the family, but the mother is an important 
            decision-maker. People are judged by their educational and family 
            backgrounds, not by race."
China,The People,"Deeply rooted in Chinese society is the need to belong and 
            conform to a unit, whether the family, a political party or an 
            organization. The family is the focus of life for most Chinese. Age 
            and rank are highly respected. However, to the dismay of older 
            people, today's young people are rapidly modernizing, wearing blue 
            jeans and sunglasses, drinking Coke and driving motorbikes."
Colombia,The People,"Colombia has one of the most successful economies in South 
            America, despite adverse conditions and a very unequal distribution 
            of wealth. A small number of Colombians hold most of the country's 
            wealth and political power, but the middle and working classes are 
            growing in Colombia's cities. Colombians are hardworking and peace 
            loving. Politeness, proper behavior, good manners and courtesy are 
            valued. Colombians are very proud of their democracy and 
            independence. They do not like or want outside interference and want 
            to address internal challenges on their own."
Denmark,The People,"Danes are respected for their accomplishments in science, art, 
            literature and architecture. They value tolerance and diversity. The 
            individual is also highly regarded in Danish culture. Danes are very 
            proud of their excellent educational system. Although the Danes 
            value close and stable family lives, they have one of the highest 
            divorce rates in Europe. Most women work outside the home."
Ecuador,The People,"Ecuadorians are hospitable and warmly welcoming of visitors. They 
            revere older people and honor experience and authority. Superiors, 
            parents and teachers are greatly respected. Ecuador is one of the 
            most racially divided countries of South America. Whites (Blancos) 
            are better off economically and educationally than the rest of the 
            population. Mestizos are usually middle class. Native Ecuadorians 
            (Indios) are considered lower class, and many live in poverty, are 
            illiterate and often don't speak Spanish. Blacks have overcome many 
            stereotypes."
Finland,The People,"Loyalty, reliability, self-sufficiency and independence are 
            highly valued. Finns are proud of their heritage and current society 
            (they are leaders in peace conferences and international peace 
            initiatives). They enjoy nature and proudly protect their 
            environment, which is one of the cleanest in the world. Finns value 
            their privacy and appreciate others respecting it."
France,The People,"The French adhere to a strong and homogeneous set of values. They 
            cherish their culture, history, language and cuisine, which is 
            considered an art. The French have been and are today world leaders 
            in fashion, food, wine, art and architecture. They embrace novelty, 
            new ideas and manners with enthusiasm as long as they are elegant."
Germany,The People,"Germans value order, privacy and punctuality. They are thrifty, 
            hard working and industrious. Germans respect perfectionism in all 
            areas of business and private life. In Germany, there is a sense of 
            community and social conscience and strong desire for belonging. To 
            admit inadequacy -- even in jest -- is incomprehensible."
Greece,The People,"Families are very important in Greece. Elders are highly 
            respected, and children care for their elderly parents. Children are 
            disciplined firmly, but parents (even those who are poor) spend a 
            great deal of their income on feeding, clothing and educating their 
            children. Men consider it a personal honor and responsibility to 
            care for their family."
Hong Kong,The People,"Hong Kong is very sophisticated and cosmopolitan, blending the 
            cultures of Asia and Europe. Its people are highly educated, very 
            motivated and westernized. Hong Kong is 98% Chinese (Cantonese), but 
            the people view themselves as different from other Chinese. 
            Cantonese habits and customs are dominant. An individual's actions, 
            prestige, education, wealth and reputation reflect positively or 
            negatively on the entire family."
India,The People,"India is one of the most diverse countries in the world. It is a 
            sophisticated, modern, industrial leader that is home to many 
            primitive tribes and millions of poor people. Religion and language 
            separate people. The caste system limits social mobility (600,000 
            people belong to the lowest caste). Because of disparities in 
            distribution of wealth, a wide gap separates the few wealthy from 
            the many poor."
Indonesia,The People,"Along with unity and conformity to society's rules, honor and 
            respect for the individual is the basis of Indonesian culture. 
            Indonesians value loyalty to family and friends above all else. Life 
            is simple for most people; most enjoy few modern conveniences, such 
            as running water. Indonesia as a whole is viewed by its people as an 
            extended family with the president, schoolmasters and leaders of 
            business enterprises referred to as ""fathers"" by the public."
Ireland,The People,"The Irish are interested in people and place great value on the 
            individual. They are naturally courteous, quick-witted and will go 
            out of their way to welcome visitors to their country. Don't rush 
            the Irish. Although they work very hard, the Irish are dedicated to 
            a less stressful lifestyle that allows time for friends and family, 
            a visit to the pub, a cup of tea, or just a bit of a chat on the 
            corner. Families are closely-knit and very important to the Irish."
Italy,The People,"Cultural achievement is Italy's greatest source of pride. 
            Inventiveness, imagination, intelligence and education are prized. 
            Personal relations are scrupulously maintained with loyalty highly 
            valued, especially in families. The family is the most important 
            affiliation in Italy."
Japan,The People,"Japan is a highly structured and traditional society. Great 
            importance is placed on loyalty, politeness, personal responsibility 
            and on everyone working together for the good of the larger group. 
            Education, ambition, hard work, patience and determination are held 
            in the highest regard. The crime rate is one of the lowest in the 
            world."
Luxembourg,The People,"Luxembourgers cherish their independence and separate identity in 
            Europe. Modesty, friendship and strong national pride are valued. 
            They enjoy a slower pace of life than most of northern Europe. 
            Family is very important. Parents influence every aspect of their 
            children's lives; however, this is weakening as more young people 
            leave the country to study/work abroad."
Malaysia,The People,"Malays are proud of their country, their ancestral background and 
            their economic success. Ethnic tensions exist between Malays (60%) 
            and Chinese (31%) over preferential quotas. Chinese feel these 
            policies make them second-class citizens; Malays support these 
            policies, which they feel are their only way to overcome traditional 
            dominance. The Chinese dominate the business community and live in 
            urban areas, while ethnic Malays generally inhabit rural areas."
Mexico,The People,"Mexico is a very class-conscious society where social 
            stratifications are well-defined. Upper class Mexicans will not 
            dirty their hands with tasks they find beneath them. A sense of 
            fatalism is quite strong among many Mexicans, who feel that their 
            path through life is largely preordained. Macho attitudes are 
            inculcated in Mexican males almost from birth, and machismo plays a 
            pervasive role in shaping Mexican culture."
Netherlands,The People,"The Dutch society is egalitarian and modern. The people are 
            modest, tolerant, independent, self-reliant, and entrepreneurial. 
            They value education, hard work, ambition and ability. The Dutch 
            have an aversion to the nonessential. Ostentatious behavior is to be 
            avoided. Accumulating money is fine, but spending money is 
            considered something of a vice. A high style is considered wasteful 
            and suspect. The Dutch are very proud of their cultural heritage, 
            rich history in art and music and involvement in international 
            affairs."
Norway,The People,"Simplicity and nature are the core of the Norwegian lifestyle. 
            Tolerance, kindness to each other and independence are highly 
            valued. Criticism of other people or others' systems is frowned 
            upon. ""Peace and progress"" are mottos in the country that sponsors 
            the Nobel Prizes. Norwegians treasure their landscape, outdoor 
            activity, sailing, cross-country skiing, etc."
Paraguay,The People,"Paraguayans are traditional, conservative people who strive for 
            tranquility (tranquilidad). Paraguay has historically been 
            voluntarily isolated. In the 19th century, the government tried to 
            seal the borders in an attempt to become self-sufficient. More 
            recently, very strict government controls have isolated the people 
            from most outside information. Inflation, foreign debt and high 
            unemployment plague this young democracy. There is a large gap 
            between the rich and poor. A few elite families control nearly all 
            the resources, and economic opportunities are limited to urban 
            dwellers."
Philippines,The People,"Filipinos are casual, fun loving, sensitive and hospitable 
            people. Personal and family honor are stressed, as well as dignity 
            and pride. Education is highly valued and families make great 
            sacrifices to educate their children. Hiya (shame) is instilled in 
            Filipinos at an early age. To be shamed is the greatest form of 
            disgrace."
Portugal,The People,"Portugal is a self-styled country comprised of generally reserved 
            and understated people. The Portuguese are traditional and 
            conservative. People do not quickly embrace change and innovation. 
            The Catholic Church has a strong influence on people's lives. The 
            family is the basis of Portuguese life. Life is simple, especially 
            in rural areas. The Portuguese go home after work and entertain on 
            weekends only."
Russia,The People,"Russia has had a long history of totalitarianism, which has 
            resulted in a rather fatalistic approach to living. The desire to 
            work individually under personal initiative was suppressed by the 
            Czarist and Communist states. With the advent of perestroika 
            (restructuring), the Soviet/Communist value system has been 
            scrapped, but the pace of reform has been slow and many are finding 
            it very difficult to adapt to the Western values of individualism 
            and profit maximization. Older Russians are generally quite 
            pessimistic and don't have much faith in a better life in the 
            future. Younger urban Russians have adopted a more Western outlook 
            on life."
Singapore,The People,"Singapore is a conglomeration of Chinese (76%), Malay (15%) and 
            Indian (6%) cultures. In the past, this racial mixture has lead to 
            some conflict. However, today most Singaporeans enjoy racial harmony 
            and national unity. Each group works hard to maintain its cultural 
            traditions while building a modern, cohesive society. Singaporeans 
            of the younger generation think of themselves as Singaporean first, 
            and as Chinese, Malay or Indian second."
South Korea,The People,"Korea is one of the most homogeneous countries in the world, 
            racially and linguistically. It has its own culture, language, dress 
            and cuisine, separate and distinct from its neighboring countries. 
            Hard work, filial piety and modesty are characteristics esteemed by 
            Koreans. They are proud of their traditional culture and their 
            modern economic success. Education is highly valued as the path to 
            status, money and success."
Spain,The People,"Personal pride and individualism are highly valued, as are 
            character and breeding. Modesty is valued over assertiveness. 
            Flaunting superiority, intelligence and ability is not appreciated. 
            People strive to project affluence and social position. Personal 
            appearance, image and human relationships are very important."
Sweden,The People,"Sweden is a predominantly middle class country with one of the 
            most far-reaching social security systems in the world. Patriotism 
            is important to Swedes, who are very proud of their nation, towns 
            and regions."
Switzerland,The People,"The Swiss value cleanliness, honesty, hard work, and material 
            possessions. Motto: ""Unity, yes; Uniformity, no."" They are very 
            proud of their environment and have a long tradition of freedom. 
            They value sobriety, thrift, tolerance, punctuality and a sense of 
            responsibility. They are very proud of their neutrality and 
            promotion of worldwide peace. The Swiss have a deep-rooted respect 
            for saving and the material wealth it brings."
Taiwan,The People,"The people of Taiwan value hard work, patience, humility, 
            friendliness and respect for others. They are highly motivated and 
            centered around the extended family, their most important economic 
            resource. They dislike loud, showy and unrefined behavior. Bringing 
            shame on anyone (""loss of face"") brings shame to the entire family."
Thailand,The People,"Thais are tolerant of individualism, but find comfort and 
            security in being part of a group. Mai Pen Rai (never mind) is the 
            Thai expression which characterizes the general focus of life - ""it 
            is to enjoy."" Thais are productive and hard working while at the 
            same time happy with what they are and what they have materially. 
            They are smiling, pleasant, humble and patient people who laugh 
            easily, speak softly, are slow to anger, and never try to cause 
            anyone to lose face. Thais are very proud of their cultural heritage 
            and enjoy talking about it with visitors. Thais are proud that they 
            have never been ruled by a Western power."
Turkey,The People,"Turks are extremely patriotic. They are proud of their ancestors 
            and of the achievements of their modern society. The family is the 
            most important social unit. Each person is dependent upon and loyal 
            to the family. Rural life is still traditional, but in cities women 
            frequently work outside the home."
United Kingdom,The People,"Four countries make up the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
            Northern Ireland -- England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 
            Residents of any of these countries may be called ""British."" Use 
            ""English,"" ""Scot"" or ""Scotsman,"" ""Welsh"" and ""Irish"" or ""Northern 
            Irish"" only when certain of a person’s heritage. While the four 
            countries share many customs, each has its own set of cultural 
            nuances."
United States,The People,"Throughout most of its history, the United States has had 
            influxes of immigration. The ethnic mix is 83% white (generally of 
            European descent, but also from the Middle East and Latin America), 
            12% African-American, 3% Asian and about 1% Native American. Today 
            the biggest immigrant groups are from Latin countries."
Uruguay,The People,"The majority of the people are middle class; the extremes of 
            wealth and poverty found in most other South American countries 
            don't exist. Uruguayans take a pragmatic, utilitarian and 
            materialistic approach to life. They have an inherent trust of 
            people and a strong belief in social justice. A great deal of 
            emphasis is placed on education. Uruguay has the best-educated 
            workforce on the continent. People enjoy easy access to a good 
            education, compulsory for nine years and free through post-graduate 
            studies. The literacy rate is 96%, one of the highest in South 
            America."
Venezuela,The People,"Venezuelans respect leadership and are a tolerant and loving 
            people. Extended family and friends are very important, and one 
            should avoid doing anything that might shame them. The upper class 
            dominates the economic structures of commerce and industry, but the 
            middle class dominates politics. People are emotionally attached to 
            the church (96% Roman Catholic), which gives them a sense of 
            stability, but religion is not a strong force in daily life. 
            Venezuelans are very proud of the fact that religious freedom is 
            guaranteed by their constitution."
Vietnam,The People,"A long struggle for independence has given the Vietnamese a deep 
            sense of national pride. Vietnamese value their independence and 
            history and offended by people who ignore or violate either. Most 
            Vietnamese have an interest in all things American. They believe all 
            past hostilities were part of the natural defense of their national 
            territory. Families are very strong and help each other in all 
            needs."
