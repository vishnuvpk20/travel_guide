14,Germany,The People,"Germans value order, privacy and punctuality. They are thrifty, 
            hard working and industrious. Germans respect perfectionism in all 
            areas of business and private life. In Germany, there is a sense of 
            community and social conscience and strong desire for belonging. To 
            admit inadequacy -- even in jest -- is incomprehensible.",4049.0
15,Greece,The People,"Families are very important in Greece. Elders are highly 
            respected, and children care for their elderly parents. Children are 
            disciplined firmly, but parents (even those who are poor) spend a 
            great deal of their income on feeding, clothing and educating their 
            children. Men consider it a personal honor and responsibility to 
            care for their family.",4561.0
16,Hong Kong,The People,"Hong Kong is very sophisticated and cosmopolitan, blending the 
            cultures of Asia and Europe. Its people are highly educated, very 
            motivated and westernized. Hong Kong is 98% Chinese (Cantonese), but 
            the people view themselves as different from other Chinese. 
            Cantonese habits and customs are dominant. An individual's actions, 
            prestige, education, wealth and reputation reflect positively or 
            negatively on the entire family.",4768.0
17,India,The People,"India is one of the most diverse countries in the world. It is a 
            sophisticated, modern, industrial leader that is home to many 
            primitive tribes and millions of poor people. Religion and language 
            separate people. The caste system limits social mobility (600,000 
            people belong to the lowest caste). Because of disparities in 
            distribution of wealth, a wide gap separates the few wealthy from 
            the many poor.",5153.0
18,Indonesia,The People,"Along with unity and conformity to society's rules, honor and 
            respect for the individual is the basis of Indonesian culture. 
            Indonesians value loyalty to family and friends above all else. Life 
            is simple for most people; most enjoy few modern conveniences, such 
            as running water. Indonesia as a whole is viewed by its people as an 
            extended family with the president, schoolmasters and leaders of 
            business enterprises referred to as ""fathers"" by the public.",5408.0
19,Ireland,The People,"The Irish are interested in people and place great value on the 
            individual. They are naturally courteous, quick-witted and will go 
            out of their way to welcome visitors to their country. Don't rush 
            the Irish. Although they work very hard, the Irish are dedicated to 
            a less stressful lifestyle that allows time for friends and family, 
            a visit to the pub, a cup of tea, or just a bit of a chat on the 
            corner. Families are closely-knit and very important to the Irish.",5664.0
20,Italy,The People,"Cultural achievement is Italy's greatest source of pride. 
            Inventiveness, imagination, intelligence and education are prized. 
            Personal relations are scrupulously maintained with loyalty highly

            Education, ambition, hard work, patience and determination are held

22,Luxembourg,The People,"Luxembourgers cherish their independence and separate identity in 
            Europe. Modesty, friendship and strong national pride are valued. 
            They enjoy a slower pace of life than most of northern Europe. 
            Family is very important. Parents influence every aspect of their

23,Malaysia,The People,"Malays are proud of their country, their ancestral background and 
            their economic success. Ethnic tensions exist between Malays (60%) 
            and Chinese (31%) over preferential quotas. Chinese feel these 
            policies make them second-class citizens; Malays support these 
            policies, which they feel are their only way to overcome traditional 
            dominance. The Chinese dominate the business community and live in 
            urban areas, while ethnic Malays generally inhabit rural areas.",6914.0
24,Mexico,The People,"Mexico is a very class-conscious society where social 
            stratifications are well-defined. Upper class Mexicans will not 
            dirty their hands with tasks they find beneath them. A sense of 
            fatalism is quite strong among many Mexicans, who feel that their 
            path through life is largely preordained. Macho attitudes are 
            inculcated in Mexican males almost from birth, and machismo plays a 
            pervasive role in shaping Mexican culture.",7173.0
25,Netherlands,The People,"The Dutch society is egalitarian and modern. The people are 
            modest, tolerant, independent, self-reliant, and entrepreneurial. 
            They value education, hard work, ambition and ability. The Dutch 
            have an aversion to the nonessential. Ostentatious behavior is to be 
            avoided. Accumulating money is fine, but spending money is 
            considered something of a vice. A high style is considered wasteful 
            and suspect. The Dutch are very proud of their cultural heritage,

            affairs.",7416.0
26,Norway,The People,"Simplicity and nature are the core of the Norwegian lifestyle. 
            Tolerance, kindness to each other and independence are highly 
            valued. Criticism of other people or others' systems is frowned 
            upon. ""Peace and progress"" are mottos in the country that sponsors

27,Paraguay,The People,"Paraguayans are traditional, conservative people who strive for 
            tranquility (tranquilidad). Paraguay has historically been 
            voluntarily isolated. In the 19th century, the government tried to 
            seal the borders in an attempt to become self-sufficient. More 
            recently, very strict government controls have isolated the people 
            from most outside information. Inflation, foreign debt and high 
            unemployment plague this young democracy. There is a large gap 
            between the rich and poor. A few elite families control nearly all 
            the resources, and economic opportunities are limited to urban 
            dwellers.",7958.0
28,Philippines,The People,"Filipinos are casual, fun loving, sensitive and hospitable 
            people. Personal and family honor are stressed, as well as dignity

29,Portugal,The People,"Portugal is a self-styled country comprised of generally reserved 
            and understated people. The Portuguese are traditional and 
            conservative. People do not quickly embrace change and innovation. 
            The Catholic Church has a strong influence on people's lives. The 
            family is the basis of Portuguese life. Life is simple, especially

30,Russia,The People,"Russia has had a long history of totalitarianism, which has 
            resulted in a rather fatalistic approach to living. The desire to 
            work individually under personal initiative was suppressed by the 
            Czarist and Communist states. With the advent of perestroika 
            (restructuring), the Soviet/Communist value system has been 
            scrapped, but the pace of reform has been slow and many are finding 
            it very difficult to adapt to the Western values of individualism 
            and profit maximization. Older Russians are generally quite 
            pessimistic and don't have much faith in a better life in the 
            future. Younger urban Russians have adopted a more Western outlook 
            on life.",8664.0
31,Singapore,The People,"Singapore is a conglomeration of Chinese (76%), Malay (15%) and 
            Indian (6%) cultures. In the past, this racial mixture has lead to 
            some conflict. However, today most Singaporeans enjoy racial harmony 
            and national unity. Each group works hard to maintain its cultural 
            traditions while building a modern, cohesive society. Singaporeans

            Koreans. They are proud of their traditional culture and their
