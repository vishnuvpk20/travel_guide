0,Argentina,The People,"Argentines are very proud of their country and culture. They are 
            well-educated and sophisticated and like to be viewed as 
            cosmopolitan and progressive. Because 85% of Argentina’s population 
            hails from Italy, Spain, Austria, France, Germany, Great Britain, 
            Portugal, Russia, Switzerland, Poland and the Middle East, 
            Argentines tend to identify with Europeans. It has been said that 
            Argentines are a nation of Italians who speak Spanish and think 
            they’re British living in Paris. Predominantly Catholic (93%), 
            families are highly valued and hold conservative values."
273,Australia,The People,"Home to nearly five million immigrants from 160 countries, 
            Australia is rich in cultural diversity. Australians, or ""Aussies,"" 
            enjoy an easy-going lifestyle and are generally friendly and 
            relaxed. Modesty and equality are valued."
499,Austria,The People,"Austrians are proud of their contributions to world civilization. 
            They see themselves as modern, liberal and cultured. Austrians have 
            a great love for the outdoors (i.e., walking, skiing, climbing, 
            etc.). Although predominantly Catholic (89%), traditional family 
            values have been weakened by modern life and government legislation. 
            The rate of women working outside the home is one of the highest in 
            the industrialized world."
734,Belgium,The People,"Belgium is comprised of two primary cultural groups. The 
            Dutch-speaking Flemings live in Flanders, in the north, and make up 
            55% of the population. The French-speaking Walloons live in 
            Wallonia, in the south, and make up 33% of the population. Hard work 
            and an appreciation for culture are important values to Belgians, 
            who think of themselves as Europeans first, Walloons or Flemings 
            second, and Belgians third. Strong family systems are vital to 
            Belgian society. Extended families live in separate homes, but often 
            settle in or near the town where they were raised."
1049,Bolivia,The People,"Bolivians are very proud of being one of the few countries that 
            have successfully promoted multicultural integration. Vice President 
            Víctor Hugo Cárdenas, elected in 1993, was the first indigenous 
            person elected to this high office in South America. Bolivians are 
            kind, gentle people, who are concerned for each other's welfare. 
            Friendship is a very important value. The family is the central unit 
            in the social system. Education is valued, but still not achievable 
            for all people. Although it is legally compulsory for ages six to 
            14, fewer than half of all children finish primary education."
1279,Brazil,The People,"Brazilians are friendly and free-spirited, with an incredible 
            zest for life. They are very risk-oriented and very creative. 
            Predominantly Roman Catholic (73%), families are large and often 
            include extended family members. Family, educational and 
            socioeconomic backgrounds are important to Brazilians."
1574,Canada,The People,"The vast majority of Canadians claim European ancestry. Four in 
            nine Canadians claim some British ancestry and a little less than 
            one in three have some French ancestry. Eighty percent of the 
            residents in Quebec have French ancestry. Eighty percent of native 
            French speakers live in Quebec (the others are mostly in New 
            Brunswick, and parts of Ontario and Manitoba). Other European groups 
            include Italians, Germans and Ukrainians (especially in the prairie 
            states)."
1891,Chile,The People,"Chileans are very nationalistic and are proud of their country, 
            as well as of their literacy -- the 95% rate puts them among the 
            best educated in the world. Predominantly Roman Catholic (89%), 
            family is the primary structure of society. The father is still 
            considered the head of the family, but the mother is an important 
            decision-maker. People are judged by their educational and family 
            backgrounds, not by race."
2200,China,The People,"Deeply rooted in Chinese society is the need to belong and 
            conform to a unit, whether the family, a political party or an 
            organization. The family is the focus of life for most Chinese. Age 
            and rank are highly respected. However, to the dismay of older 
            people, today's young people are rapidly modernizing, wearing blue 
            jeans and sunglasses, drinking Coke and driving motorbikes."
2771,Colombia,The People,"Colombia has one of the most successful economies in South 
            America, despite adverse conditions and a very unequal distribution 
            of wealth. A small number of Colombians hold most of the country's 
            wealth and political power, but the middle and working classes are 
            growing in Colombia's cities. Colombians are hardworking and peace 
            loving. Politeness, proper behavior, good manners and courtesy are 
            valued. Colombians are very proud of their democracy and 
            independence. They do not like or want outside interference and want 
            to address internal challenges on their own."
2981,Denmark,The People,"Danes are respected for their accomplishments in science, art, 
            literature and architecture. They value tolerance and diversity. The 
            individual is also highly regarded in Danish culture. Danes are very 
            proud of their excellent educational system. Although the Danes 
            value close and stable family lives, they have one of the highest 
            divorce rates in Europe. Most women work outside the home."
3192,Ecuador,The People,"Ecuadorians are hospitable and warmly welcoming of visitors. They 
            revere older people and honor experience and authority. Superiors, 
            parents and teachers are greatly respected. Ecuador is one of the 
            most racially divided countries of South America. Whites (Blancos) 
            are better off economically and educationally than the rest of the 
            population. Mestizos are usually middle class. Native Ecuadorians 
            (Indios) are considered lower class, and many live in poverty, are 
            illiterate and often don't speak Spanish. Blacks have overcome many 
            stereotypes."
3388,Finland,The People,"Loyalty, reliability, self-sufficiency and independence are 
            highly valued. Finns are proud of their heritage and current society 
            (they are leaders in peace conferences and international peace 
            initiatives). They enjoy nature and proudly protect their 
            environment, which is one of the cleanest in the world. Finns value 
            their privacy and appreciate others respecting it."
3543,France,The People,"The French adhere to a strong and homogeneous set of values. They 
            cherish their culture, history, language and cuisine, which is 
            considered an art. The French have been and are today world leaders 
            in fashion, food, wine, art and architecture. They embrace novelty, 
            new ideas and manners with enthusiasm as long as they are elegant."
4049,Germany,The People,"Germans value order, privacy and punctuality. They are thrifty, 
            hard working and industrious. Germans respect perfectionism in all 
            areas of business and private life. In Germany, there is a sense of 
            community and social conscience and strong desire for belonging. To 
            admit inadequacy -- even in jest -- is incomprehensible."
4561,Greece,The People,"Families are very important in Greece. Elders are highly 
            respected, and children care for their elderly parents. Children are 
            disciplined firmly, but parents (even those who are poor) spend a 
            great deal of their income on feeding, clothing and educating their 
            children. Men consider it a personal honor and responsibility to 
            care for their family."
4768,Hong Kong,The People,"Hong Kong is very sophisticated and cosmopolitan, blending the 
            cultures of Asia and Europe. Its people are highly educated, very 
            motivated and westernized. Hong Kong is 98% Chinese (Cantonese), but 
            the people view themselves as different from other Chinese. 
            Cantonese habits and customs are dominant. An individual's actions, 
            prestige, education, wealth and reputation reflect positively or 
            negatively on the entire family."
5153,India,The People,"India is one of the most diverse countries in the world. It is a 
            sophisticated, modern, industrial leader that is home to many 
            primitive tribes and millions of poor people. Religion and language 
            separate people. The caste system limits social mobility (600,000 
            people belong to the lowest caste). Because of disparities in 
            distribution of wealth, a wide gap separates the few wealthy from 
            the many poor."
5408,Indonesia,The People,"Along with unity and conformity to society's rules, honor and 
            respect for the individual is the basis of Indonesian culture. 
            Indonesians value loyalty to family and friends above all else. Life 
            is simple for most people; most enjoy few modern conveniences, such 
            as running water. Indonesia as a whole is viewed by its people as an 
            extended family with the president, schoolmasters and leaders of 
            business enterprises referred to as ""fathers"" by the public."
5664,Ireland,The People,"The Irish are interested in people and place great value on the 
            individual. They are naturally courteous, quick-witted and will go 
            out of their way to welcome visitors to their country. Don't rush 
            the Irish. Although they work very hard, the Irish are dedicated to 
            a less stressful lifestyle that allows time for friends and family, 
            a visit to the pub, a cup of tea, or just a bit of a chat on the 
            corner. Families are closely-knit and very important to the Irish."
5916,Italy,The People,"Cultural achievement is Italy's greatest source of pride. 
            Inventiveness, imagination, intelligence and education are prized. 
            Personal relations are scrupulously maintained with loyalty highly 
            valued, especially in families. The family is the most important 
            affiliation in Italy."
6443,Japan,The People,"Japan is a highly structured and traditional society. Great 
            importance is placed on loyalty, politeness, personal responsibility 
            and on everyone working together for the good of the larger group. 
            Education, ambition, hard work, patience and determination are held 
            in the highest regard. The crime rate is one of the lowest in the 
            world."
6732,Luxembourg,The People,"Luxembourgers cherish their independence and separate identity in 
            Europe. Modesty, friendship and strong national pride are valued. 
            They enjoy a slower pace of life than most of northern Europe. 
            Family is very important. Parents influence every aspect of their 
            children's lives; however, this is weakening as more young people 
            leave the country to study/work abroad."
6914,Malaysia,The People,"Malays are proud of their country, their ancestral background and 
            their economic success. Ethnic tensions exist between Malays (60%) 
            and Chinese (31%) over preferential quotas. Chinese feel these 
            policies make them second-class citizens; Malays support these 
            policies, which they feel are their only way to overcome traditional 
            dominance. The Chinese dominate the business community and live in 
            urban areas, while ethnic Malays generally inhabit rural areas."
7173,Mexico,The People,"Mexico is a very class-conscious society where social 
            stratifications are well-defined. Upper class Mexicans will not 
            dirty their hands with tasks they find beneath them. A sense of 
            fatalism is quite strong among many Mexicans, who feel that their 
            path through life is largely preordained. Macho attitudes are 
            inculcated in Mexican males almost from birth, and machismo plays a 
            pervasive role in shaping Mexican culture."
7416,Netherlands,The People,"The Dutch society is egalitarian and modern. The people are 
            modest, tolerant, independent, self-reliant, and entrepreneurial. 
            They value education, hard work, ambition and ability. The Dutch 
            have an aversion to the nonessential. Ostentatious behavior is to be 
            avoided. Accumulating money is fine, but spending money is 
            considered something of a vice. A high style is considered wasteful 
            and suspect. The Dutch are very proud of their cultural heritage, 
            rich history in art and music and involvement in international 
            affairs."
7783,Norway,The People,"Simplicity and nature are the core of the Norwegian lifestyle. 
            Tolerance, kindness to each other and independence are highly 
            valued. Criticism of other people or others' systems is frowned 
            upon. ""Peace and progress"" are mottos in the country that sponsors 
            the Nobel Prizes. Norwegians treasure their landscape, outdoor 
            activity, sailing, cross-country skiing, etc."
7958,Paraguay,The People,"Paraguayans are traditional, conservative people who strive for 
            tranquility (tranquilidad). Paraguay has historically been 
            voluntarily isolated. In the 19th century, the government tried to 
            seal the borders in an attempt to become self-sufficient. More 
            recently, very strict government controls have isolated the people 
            from most outside information. Inflation, foreign debt and high 
            unemployment plague this young democracy. There is a large gap 
            between the rich and poor. A few elite families control nearly all 
            the resources, and economic opportunities are limited to urban 
            dwellers."
8185,Philippines,The People,"Filipinos are casual, fun loving, sensitive and hospitable 
            people. Personal and family honor are stressed, as well as dignity 
            and pride. Education is highly valued and families make great 
            sacrifices to educate their children. Hiya (shame) is instilled in 
            Filipinos at an early age. To be shamed is the greatest form of 
            disgrace."
8445,Portugal,The People,"Portugal is a self-styled country comprised of generally reserved 
            and understated people. The Portuguese are traditional and 
            conservative. People do not quickly embrace change and innovation. 
            The Catholic Church has a strong influence on people's lives. The 
            family is the basis of Portuguese life. Life is simple, especially 
            in rural areas. The Portuguese go home after work and entertain on 
            weekends only."
8664,Russia,The People,"Russia has had a long history of totalitarianism, which has 
            resulted in a rather fatalistic approach to living. The desire to 
            work individually under personal initiative was suppressed by the 
            Czarist and Communist states. With the advent of perestroika 
            (restructuring), the Soviet/Communist value system has been 
            scrapped, but the pace of reform has been slow and many are finding 
            it very difficult to adapt to the Western values of individualism 
            and profit maximization. Older Russians are generally quite 
            pessimistic and don't have much faith in a better life in the 
            future. Younger urban Russians have adopted a more Western outlook 
            on life."
8904,Singapore,The People,"Singapore is a conglomeration of Chinese (76%), Malay (15%) and 
            Indian (6%) cultures. In the past, this racial mixture has lead to 
            some conflict. However, today most Singaporeans enjoy racial harmony 
            and national unity. Each group works hard to maintain its cultural 
            traditions while building a modern, cohesive society. Singaporeans 
            of the younger generation think of themselves as Singaporean first, 
            and as Chinese, Malay or Indian second."
9158,South Korea,The People,"Korea is one of the most homogeneous countries in the world, 
            racially and linguistically. It has its own culture, language, dress 
            and cuisine, separate and distinct from its neighboring countries. 
            Hard work, filial piety and modesty are characteristics esteemed by 
            Koreans. They are proud of their traditional culture and their 
            modern economic success. Education is highly valued as the path to 
            status, money and success."
9497,Spain,The People,"Personal pride and individualism are highly valued, as are 
            character and breeding. Modesty is valued over assertiveness. 
            Flaunting superiority, intelligence and ability is not appreciated. 
            People strive to project affluence and social position. Personal 
            appearance, image and human relationships are very important."
9747,Sweden,The People,"Sweden is a predominantly middle class country with one of the 
            most far-reaching social security systems in the world. Patriotism 
            is important to Swedes, who are very proud of their nation, towns 
            and regions."
10049,Switzerland,The People,"The Swiss value cleanliness, honesty, hard work, and material 
            possessions. Motto: ""Unity, yes; Uniformity, no."" They are very 
            proud of their environment and have a long tradition of freedom. 
            They value sobriety, thrift, tolerance, punctuality and a sense of 
            responsibility. They are very proud of their neutrality and 
            promotion of worldwide peace. The Swiss have a deep-rooted respect 
            for saving and the material wealth it brings."
10361,Taiwan,The People,"The people of Taiwan value hard work, patience, humility, 
            friendliness and respect for others. They are highly motivated and 
            centered around the extended family, their most important economic 
            resource. They dislike loud, showy and unrefined behavior. Bringing 
            shame on anyone (""loss of face"") brings shame to the entire family."
10645,Thailand,The People,"Thais are tolerant of individualism, but find comfort and 
            security in being part of a group. Mai Pen Rai (never mind) is the 
            Thai expression which characterizes the general focus of life - ""it 
            is to enjoy."" Thais are productive and hard working while at the 
            same time happy with what they are and what they have materially. 
            They are smiling, pleasant, humble and patient people who laugh 
            easily, speak softly, are slow to anger, and never try to cause 
            anyone to lose face. Thais are very proud of their cultural heritage 
            and enjoy talking about it with visitors. Thais are proud that they 
            have never been ruled by a Western power."
10993,Turkey,The People,"Turks are extremely patriotic. They are proud of their ancestors 
            and of the achievements of their modern society. The family is the 
            most important social unit. Each person is dependent upon and loyal 
            to the family. Rural life is still traditional, but in cities women 
            frequently work outside the home."
11169,United Kingdom,The People,"Four countries make up the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
            Northern Ireland -- England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 
            Residents of any of these countries may be called ""British."" Use 
            ""English,"" ""Scot"" or ""Scotsman,"" ""Welsh"" and ""Irish"" or ""Northern 
            Irish"" only when certain of a person’s heritage. While the four 
            countries share many customs, each has its own set of cultural 
            nuances."
11609,United States,The People,"Throughout most of its history, the United States has had 
            influxes of immigration. The ethnic mix is 83% white (generally of 
            European descent, but also from the Middle East and Latin America), 
            12% African-American, 3% Asian and about 1% Native American. Today 
            the biggest immigrant groups are from Latin countries."
12029,Uruguay,The People,"The majority of the people are middle class; the extremes of 
            wealth and poverty found in most other South American countries 
            don't exist. Uruguayans take a pragmatic, utilitarian and 
            materialistic approach to life. They have an inherent trust of 
            people and a strong belief in social justice. A great deal of 
            emphasis is placed on education. Uruguay has the best-educated 
            workforce on the continent. People enjoy easy access to a good 
            education, compulsory for nine years and free through post-graduate 
            studies. The literacy rate is 96%, one of the highest in South 
            America."
12241,Venezuela,The People,"Venezuelans respect leadership and are a tolerant and loving 
            people. Extended family and friends are very important, and one 
            should avoid doing anything that might shame them. The upper class 
            dominates the economic structures of commerce and industry, but the 
            middle class dominates politics. People are emotionally attached to 
            the church (96% Roman Catholic), which gives them a sense of 
            stability, but religion is not a strong force in daily life. 
            Venezuelans are very proud of the fact that religious freedom is 
            guaranteed by their constitution."
12459,Vietnam,The People,"A long struggle for independence has given the Vietnamese a deep 
            sense of national pride. Vietnamese value their independence and 
            history and offended by people who ignore or violate either. Most 
            Vietnamese have an interest in all things American. They believe all 
            past hostilities were part of the natural defense of their national 
            territory. Families are very strong and help each other in all 
            needs."
